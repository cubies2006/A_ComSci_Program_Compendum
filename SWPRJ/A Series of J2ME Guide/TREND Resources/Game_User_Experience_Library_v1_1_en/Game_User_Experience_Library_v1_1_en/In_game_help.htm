<h2>In-game help</h2>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Provide in-game help</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Users do not typically remember help text. It is much 
 better to provide information to users when they need it. If it is relevant 
 to their situation, it is more likely they’ll remember it.</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">Provide 
 in-game help to the user. The most common in-game help is to provide a 
 separate training mode or have the first level serve as a training level. 
 The training mode can have instructions, animations, and so on, to teach 
 the game logic.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">In-game 
 help can be provided in the form of “information items.” When the player 
 walks over these items, text appears. If the text is very short, it can 
 be displayed in full, such as “Thieves, look out.” For longer text, use 
 text that tells the user how to access the longer text, for example, “Press 
 8 to read note.”</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">It is 
 important to keep in mind that help text must not interfere with the experienced 
 players’ game. This can be accomplished by having a separate training 
 mode or level or providing a setting to switch in-game help off. Information 
 items could also be designed so that they are not picked accidentally. 
 When using the training mode, the real game should not be instructed.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">There 
 might not need to be a special visible item for help, although it is recommended. 
 Short text can appear automatically when the player encounters the first 
 enemy of a certain kind, for example.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">Text 
 should also appear when players encounter new items or new controls that 
 they haven't used before. Examples of in-game help include “Press 3 to 
 jump,” “Press 8 to dive,” or “Take the treasure.”</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">The in-game 
 help system can also impart some of the game’s story by, for example, 
 telling the player what must be done next. However, if this is necessary, 
 it is possible that the story is obscure and not immediately understandable 
 by the player. It may be preferable to simplify the game story.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">In-game 
 help can also be provided for movement, especially if it is not evident 
 that the player can move. The first time the character is visible, show 
 arrows around him and corresponding controls beside the arrows.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">The in-game 
 help feature should not stop the game. The players should be able to skip 
 the help should they so choose. Help text that pauses the game is annoying 
 to advanced players.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">Controls 
 should appear near the object they are controlling. For example, arrows 
 with 4 and 6 could appear beside the player’s character, not at the top 
 or the bottom of the screen.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>
