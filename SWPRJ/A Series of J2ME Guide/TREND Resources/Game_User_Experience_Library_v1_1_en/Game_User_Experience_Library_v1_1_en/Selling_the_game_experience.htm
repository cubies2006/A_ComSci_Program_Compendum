<h2>Selling the game experience</h2>

<p class=BodyCopy>This article gives guidance to game developers and distributors 
 on how to sell and deliver positive game experiences. A game experience 
 research team analyzed top selling games and some of their sales portals 
 on three continents: Asia, Europe, and North America. Two or three portals 
 from each continent and altogether 30 games were informally evaluated 
 and analyzed, but no user testing was conducted this time. Names or game 
 titles are not mentioned to protect the reputation of developers. The 
 research was funded by Forum Nokia and conducted by Idean Research. Instead 
 of focusing on reporting research results, this article concentrates on 
 giving insights to game developers, publishers, distributors, and intellectual 
 property owners for building a mobile game market with a lasting value.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>This is what we learned: There are some fantastic games, 
 but there are also games with substandard quality, offering poor game 
 experience. However, the marketing material, concept, or branding of the 
 top selling games have some interesting properties that game developers 
 concentrating on high quality games should take into account. Similar 
 considerations about the varying quality of user experience and the dominant 
 effect of visibility on operator portals have also been raised before 
 in various sources. [1, 2, 3, 4]</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Shopping for an experience</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Unlike computer games, mobile games are not very well 
 thought-out purchases. Mobile games, ring tones, and logos are massively 
 advertised in many magazines, Web sites and WAP portals, and even in television, 
 but rarely reviewed. Typically the advertisement is crammed with games 
 — there is something for everyone! Mobile games are bought with very little 
 information about the game itself. Sometimes only the game name is shown, 
 with a screenshot and a few descriptive sentences. Actual reviews are 
 usually seen only in dedicated media for hardcore game players. </p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Given that, it is no wonder that consumers seem to go 
 for the familiar-looking games based on licensed intellectual property 
 or familiar game types. A game experience is not just about the game. 
 The player's current experience is affected by his past. Previous experiences, 
 knowledge, and opinions all have an effect on how he feels about playing 
 the game. When browsing a game list, a familiar-looking movie title or 
 game type might just be the thing that gets the user’s attention. </p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Developers’ dilemma </p>

<p class=BodyCopy>There is only so much that can be communicated with just 
 a few words, or in a single picture, but still all the necessary elements 
 should be present. The key is to keep the game titles informative. You 
 need to grab users’ attention with something that they can relate to their 
 previous experiences. According to our sample, at least the following 
 strategies can be used to attract the attention of potential players:</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;"><b 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Licensing,</b> for example movie titles, other 
 games, comics, athletes, or celebrities.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;"><b 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Familiar game type</b>, for example, by using 
 familiar words like &quot;Strategy,&quot; &quot;Tycoon,&quot; &quot;Action,&quot; 
 &quot;Shoot,&quot; &quot;Adventure,&quot; &quot;Puzzle,&quot; or &quot;Racer.&quot;</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;"><b 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Familiar mood and genre</b>, by using words 
 and images like &quot;Mafia,&quot; &quot;Tank,&quot; &quot;Food,&quot; 
 &quot;Soccer,&quot; &quot;Fighting,&quot; &quot;Puppy,&quot; &quot;Boyfriend,&quot; 
 &quot;Kittens,&quot; or &quot;Bad.&quot;</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;"><b 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Referring to a specific local or global cultural 
 heritage</b>, by utilizing concepts like &quot;Dragon,&quot; &quot;Baseball,&quot; 
 or &quot;Pub.&quot;</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p class=InlineNormal2>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>The same idea goes for the detailed game descriptions 
 and pictures: They should communicate something about the game. Using 
 screenshots from the actual game is a good practice because it is hard 
 to be more descriptive than that. </p>

<p class=BodyCopy>To conclude: The game visuals, name, and brand should 
 communicate the game concept and idea. They should have &quot;mental hooks&quot; 
 that can be easily connected to previous experiences and things people 
 like. Also understanding the local nature of mobile content is important. 
 You do not have to please everyone — it is far better to catch the full 
 attention of those who might be interested in your game. The mobile content 
 business is inherently local — just take a look at the ring tone and background 
 image advertisements in your local newspaper. </p>

<p class=BodyCopy>See the figure for an example of the dragon game marketing 
 material. The screenshots and game description communicate effectively 
 the genre and type of game. Note also that this game is more localized 
 to Western markets, where &quot;Dragons&quot; are associated with less 
 positive attributes than in Eastern cultures.<span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=FigureText><img src="Game_User_Experience_Library_v1_1_en_files/image140.jpg" width="177px" height="208px" border="0" class="img_whs3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="Game_User_Experience_Library_v1_1_en_files/image141.jpg" width="177px" height="208px" border="0" class="img_whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class=FigureText>Be a fire-breathing dragon! Burn down villages, hunt 
 flocks of cattle, gather treasures,&nbsp;and fight against human armies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=FigureText><span style="color: #000000;"><font color=black >Use the power of&nbsp;your 
 wings and fire to&nbsp;destroy as many helpless humans as you can. Game 
 missions include burning down all buildings, attacking heavily armed fortresses, 
 and dueling with knights, as well as k</font></span>eeping the energy level above 
 the critical level by eating cattle. </p>

<p class=InlineFigureText>Figure: Example marketing material</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Distributing in style </p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Providing low-quality games that sell well because of 
 good titles is not only short-sighted but it also hurts the mobile game 
 markets. The whole industry needs to work together to ensure the quality 
 of mobile content. [2] There are lots of excellent games offering positive 
 user experiences. The problem is that they might not be promoted to users. 
 From the game distributor point of view this means that they should:</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;"><b 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Focus on quality games.</b> Do not just promote 
 games with familiar names from the latest blockbuster movies. Good titles 
 may sell games on short term, but on the longer term only quality games 
 and a positive overall user experience make customers come back. </p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;"><b 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Provide enough information about the mobile 
 games. </b>This makes it easier for users to find the quality games they 
 like. Use several pictures and include actual screenshots. It would be 
 even better to offer animations or downloadable game demos.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;"><b 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Ensure the positive user experience</b> in 
 game sales channels, including the downloading and payment process. [3]</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;"><b 
 style="font-weight: bold;">Determine the right metrics for success.</b> 
 Focusing on the numbers of short-term sales may distort the picture towards 
 games with good titles, regardless of the content quality. Develop metrics 
 for measuring the game experience and customer satisfaction for a long-lasting 
 value.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p class=BodyCopy>Because digital “shelf space” is a major issue in selling 
 mobile games [1], it should be used wisely. Good visibility can sell any 
 game well, but it can sell an excellent game even better.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Quality in possession</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Developing mobile games is challenging, but it is not 
 rocket science. Intellectual property owners should focus on and demand 
 a high quality implementation of their property. [2] The right developers 
 are able to produce a high-quality game experience. Methods, tools, and 
 services to ensure game experience quality have been available for several 
 years. See <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/usability"

 excellent games offering positive user experiences, and the whole mobile 
 industry needs to work together to ensure that they are delivered to users.
