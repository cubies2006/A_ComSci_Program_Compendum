<h2>Save the user’s time</h2>

<p class=BodyCopy>Efficiency must be assessed from the user’s point of 
 view. If saving a game takes ten seconds but the user can continue playing 
 at the same time, this is better than taking five seconds to save during 
 which time the user must wait. The latter may be technically faster, but 
 the user doesn't perceive it that way. Time spent navigating and configuring 
 the game should be kept to a minimum, and time spent playing to a maximum. 
 Users should understand what they must do in the game.</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">Whenever 
 possible, the game must provide reasonable default values for data requested 
 from the user. If the user has previously entered data, that value should 
 be used as the default. If no data has been entered, provide a reasonable 
 value, or zeroes, for numerical data to indicate the data format. However, 
 defaults should not be provided if no purpose is served. For example, 
 there is no point in providing “First name Surname” as a default value 
 in a player name field — this does not save the users’ time because they 
 must erase the old text anyway. However, it does make sense to provide 
 a famous athlete's name in a sports game.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">The game 
 should remember what the users have done and not force them to do it again. 
 For example, if the game challenge comes primarily from solving puzzles 
 on levels, the game should not require the user to play these levels every 
 time if there is no additional challenge. The user should be able to start 
 up on the level that was last achieved, but should also be able to restart 
 from level 1.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">The game 
 must preserve all the data the user has entered. This applies to the name 
 the user has given, the options selected before playing, and the options 
 selected during the game.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">Passwords 
 should not be remembered by default, but this possibility should be available 
 for users.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">The player 
 must be involved in the game quickly. It is crucial to get the players 
 in the game and arouse their interest. This means that there should be 
 no complicated settings to adjust before playing, or there should be a 
 “quick-start” option.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">If possible, 
 time-consuming operations should be done in the background while the user 
 does something else.</p></li>
