<h2>Mobile game usability</h2>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Definition of usability</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Usability is not a one-dimensional property. It has many 
 overlapping components; some even contradict one another. In most cases, 
 usability is associated with the following attributes:</p>

<p class=FigureText>Table: Usability factors</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Game usability needs to be differentiated from playability, 
 which refers to a user's overall experience with a certain game. The most 
 comprehensive definition of playability states: <i>The degree to which 
 a game is fun to play, with an emphasis on the interaction style and plot-quality 
 of the game; the quality of gameplay</i>. Playability is affected by the 
 quality of the storyline, responsiveness, pace, usability, customizability, 
 control, intensity of interaction, intricacy, and strategy, as well as 
 the degree of realism and the quality of the graphics and sound.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>The importance of the usability factors mentioned in 
 the table above varies — for example, in a flight-booking system for expert 
 use, efficiency and lack of errors are very important, but for an information 
 kiosk, learnability, memorability, and satisfaction are higher priorities.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Game applications are not terribly complicated when compared 
 with word-processing applications, for example. Mobile games are typically 
 played for quite brief periods of time. They are played for enjoyment 
 or challenge, which pose different usability needs. The special nature 
 of games, especially mobile games with their small screens, creates special 
 needs for their user interface.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Care must be taken to ensure that the game interface 
 and concept are pleasing to the user. This also means lack of distress 
 and irritation. The key to usability is simplicity — a complex solution 
 is itself a problem. Efficiency is not a particularly important usability 
 attribute for games, at least not in and of itself. In the end, of course, 
 efficiency produces satisfaction and it must not be ignored; however, 
 the user is not usually trying to leave the game as soon as possible.</p>

	align=left><img src="Game_User_Experience_Library_v1_1_en_files/image071.jpg" width="387px" height="458px" border="0" class="img_whs5"></p>

<p class=FigureText>Figure: Components of playability</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>The most important of all usability criteria is simple: 
 <i>Know the user</i>. In order to design a product, a designer must know 
 the audience. Making guesses about the age or education level of the users 
 is a risky foundation for a business.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Even with demographic data at hand, it is not always 
 clear what conclusions to draw. With mobile games, it is essential to 
 know where they are being played, for how long at a sitting, in what situations, 
 how they are paid for, what the function of playing is, and so on. All 
 of these factors need to be considered in the design.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Usability requirements</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Different usability attributes are usually weighted differently. 
 With games, satisfaction is probably the most important criterion. However, 
 measuring usability requirements can pose problems. Some attributes are 
 somewhat subjective, such as satisfaction, but their target levels can 
 be set and evaluated nonetheless. The table below lists possible metrics 
 for defining and evaluating the usability standard.</p>

<p class=FigureText>Table: Usability metrics</p>

<p class=BodyHeading2>How to set the requirements</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Different levels of usability can be specified for each 
 attribute evaluated. For example, let’s assume satisfaction is measured 
 on a scale from 1 to 5. Optimal performance is 5, but the target level 
 may be set at 4, which is still difficult to achieve. The minimum acceptable 
 level could be set at 3 and the current level assigned a value of 2.5.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Other attributes, such as the number of errors, are more 
 straightforward to evaluate. Identifying them may, however, require experience 
 and expertise. A fairly simple method is to evaluate an existing user 
 interface with real users and use that as a basis for new requirements.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>When no competing products exist to use as a benchmark, 
 usability goals are very hard to establish. However, projects rarely start 
 from scratch without any kind of prior knowledge or experience. The minimum 
 level of usability should be set to what it was on a previous project. 
 </p>

<p class=BodyHeading2>When to set the requirements</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Usability requirements should be defined when the other 
 requirements of the game have been established. At that point, it is not 
 usually possible to define the exact numerical values for the evaluation, 
 especially since the questionnaires have not been drafted and the final 
 UI of the game has not been implemented. However, the requirements can 
 be established in a less detailed way and the weight of each usability 
 attribute can be assessed. Typically the usability requirements are defined 
 after the technical requirements have been set.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>If the usability requirements are defined too late in 
 the process, it may be too expensive to implement them, even if it turns 
 out that the requirements are not being met. Therefore, the requirements 
 must be laid out before programming begins, and usability should be evaluated 
 against the requirements at different stages of the development cycle.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Cost justification</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>The product development cycle as a whole must be profitable. 
 This means that eventually usability research and implementation must 
 pay off in increased sales, increased productivity, decreased support, 
 and so on.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading2>The user's experience</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>If users feel stupid, incompetent, or frustrated when 
 using an application, they most likely will not touch it again unless 
 they have to. With games, the user <i>never</i> has to play — this means 
 that a positive user experience is a necessity. The whole point of a game 
 is to provide a positive user experience. </p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Companies that invest in ease-of-use enjoy increased 
 sales and a positive image. Good usability as a result of user testing, 
 usability research, and implementation of these guidelines will yield 
 at least some of the following results:</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs6">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs7">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Shorter 
 learning curve for games</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Increased 
 likelihood that the player will buy the game</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets

 can focus on the game instead of user interface details </p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets

 harmonized user interface of Series 40 and S60 games</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Decreased 
 number of changes in the final stages where they are the most expensive 
 to implement</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Increased 
 sales through reliable company reputation </p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Shorter 
 development cycle for games and reduced number of necessary iterations</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p class=BodyCopy>These benefits have been established through research, 
 some of it via Web sites rather than applications. Investing in usability 
 can be summed up as follows:</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs6">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs7">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Return 
 on investment in usability for a typical project is between 200% and 800%.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Average 
 percentage of development budget required for usability is just 2.2%.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Key 
 cost metrics (such as support calls, use of help features) fall by at 
 least 10%.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Conversion 
 ratios (sales) increase by an average of 16%.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p class=BodyCopy>Case studies are too numerous to be listed, but a few 
 examples make the point:</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs6">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs7">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">For 
 developers and manufacturers, the advantages of creating usable products 
 far outweigh the costs. The rule of thumb: every dollar invested in ease 
 of use returns $10 to $100.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Systems 
 designed with usability engineering have typically reduced the time needed 
 for training by around 25%. User-centered design typically cuts errors 
 in user-system interaction from 5% to 1%.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Revenues 
 for one Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) product that was developed 
 using user-centered design techniques increased 80% for the new version 
 of the software, and usability was cited by customers as the second most 
 significant improvement.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p class=BodyHeading2>Make it right</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Investing in usability may seem like an extra burden 
 on top of everything else, but this view doesn't take the benefits into 
 account. The sooner problems are found, the more time is saved and the 
 more money is made. It is about 40 to 100 times more expensive to fix 
 problems in the maintenance phase of a program than in the design phase. 
 Again, there are several case studies and research projects proving these 
 points:</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs6">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs7">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">For 
 enterprise software and Web sites, 80% of the software lifecycle costs 
 occur after the product is released, in the maintenance phase. Of that 
 work, 80% is due to unmet or unseen user requirements; only 20% is due 
 to bugs or reliability problems.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Without 
 user-centered design, a user interface of a software product typically 
 has around 40 flaws that can slow users and lead to errors.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">Around 
 63% of software projects exceed their cost estimates. The top four reasons 
 are: 1) frequent requests for changes from users, 2) overlooked tasks, 
 3) users' lack of understanding of their own requirements, 4) insufficient 
 user-analyst communication and understanding.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-Cbodytextbullets><p class=bodytextbullets
												style="margin-left: 0in;">If 
 it costs $10 to make a program change during development, it will probably 
 cost $400 to make the change after the system is in the field.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>

 by Randolph G. Bias and Deborah J. Mayhew.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading2>Usability return on investment</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>To sum it up, Jakob Nielsen, a usability pioneer and 
 guru, states that developers should invest 10% of their project costs 
 in usability for maximum payoff. However, return on investment (ROI) is 
 more difficult to assess with usability, since costs are measured in money 
 while usability is measured in increased use, more efficient use, or greater 
 user satisfaction. </p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Converting usability improvements to dollars is easy 
 in e-commerce, where doubled sales have an immediate value. For intranets, 
 productivity gains are also fairly easy to convert into monetary estimates: 
 simply multiply the time saved by the hourly cost of employees.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Other types of design projects are harder to convert 
 into an exact ROI. What is the value of increased customer satisfaction? 
 Of more traffic or increased use of a Web site's target features? These 
 estimates vary between companies, and thus the monetary value of doubled 
 usability also varies. However, it will be substantial in most cases.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Typically, the more people use a design, the bigger the 
 usability ROI, since the benefits come from the added value that ease 
 of use brings to each user. For an application with many users the benefits 
 are greater than for an application with a limited user base. Typically 
 games, especially successful ones, have a very large and variable user 
 base. This translates into making usability a high priority, since the 
 benefits are substantial.</p>
