<h2>Sounds</h2>

<p class=BodyHeading1>No sound abuse</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Most players think that sound in mobile games is nice 
 but not necessary. In user testing conducted for creating this guidelines 
 document, users rarely commented on a game’s sound, and when they did, 
 the comments were almost always negative. It is important not to annoy 
 users with too many or loud sounds.</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">Keep 
 the sound volume close to the volume of the device’s regular sound — not 
 too quiet, but not much louder, either.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">Sounds 
 must not be too loud or too high-pitched, and users must be able to turn 
 sounds off easily. The game must be playable without sound and there must 
 be a visual signal for each event that the sounds symbolize.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">In Bluetooth 
 multiplayer games, background music should be synchronized for all players 
 to avoid an auditory mess.</p></li>
		
		<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
			
			<li style="list-style: circle;"
				type=circle
				class=kadov-p-CGuideline2><p class=Guideline2
											style="margin-left: 0in;"><span 
 style="font-style: normal;">Allow the user to adjust the sound level of 
 both background music and tones in those devices where it is possible. 
 </span><span lang=EN-GB
				style="font-style: normal;">Allow setting the volume close 
 to silent. On some devices this has to be done by setting the volume of 
 sound files lower, or mixing the sound yourself, instead of just relying 
 on the audio APIs. </span></p></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Use unique sounds</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>The sounds of a game must be different from the sounds 
 of the device, as well as distinctive from each other. The user must be 
 able to differentiate among the sounds, even without seeing the screen.</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">The sounds 
 should be unique — they must not be confused with one another.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">Sounds 
 should be consistent with what happens in the game — sad events should 
 produce sad sounds and happy events should produce happy sounds.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">The sounds 
 must not sound like ring tones, SMS tones, and so on.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Relay information</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>The auditory channel is an excellent way to relay information 
 about things that are outside the user’s attention. The user should be 
 aware of what goes on in the game, which translates into using sound as 
 a way of communicating with the user. Also it is noteworthy that in Bluetooth 
 multiplayer games, sounds from one player’s device relay information to 
 other players as well, because players are close to each other. Sad sounds 
 from the opponent’s game may be happy sounds for the winning user.</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0pt;">Sounds 
 should convey information, and can be used as an additional channel to 
 relay information to the player.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Do not rely solely on sounds</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Very often mobile games are played in situations where 
 sounds must be turned off. The game cannot assume that the user has the 
 sounds on.</p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0pt;">Make 
 the game playable and understandable without sounds.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Profiles</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>If the users set their device to silent, they expect 
 the game sounds to be silent, too. The user would be surprised to hear 
 background music or tones when the device is silent — especially if the 
 game is being played in a public place, such as in a church or a school. 
 </p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0pt;">Provide 
 a sound menu in the game to make sure the player can deactivate sounds.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p class=InlineBodyHeading><img src="Game_User_Experience_Library_v1_1_en_files/image019.gif" alt="*" width="34px" height="15px" border="0" class="img_whs3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="Game_User_Experience_Library_v1_1_en_files/image017.gif" width="54px" height="15px" border="0" class="img_whs4"></p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0pt;">Game 
 sound level should be adjusted according to the currently active profile. 
 The <span class=CodeinText>CSettingInfo</span> interface can be used to 
 determine the active profile.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p class=InlineBodyHeading><img src="Game_User_Experience_Library_v1_1_en_files/image019.gif" alt="*" width="34px" height="15px" border="0" class="img_whs3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span lang=EN-GB><img src="Game_User_Experience_Library_v1_1_en_files/image016.jpg" width="26px" height="15px" border="0" class="img_whs5"></span></p>

<ol type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">In MIDP 
 2.0, MIDI sounds follow the device profile, but tones played by games 
 are audible, even when the device profile has been set to silent. Notice 
 that this is opposite from MIDP 1.0. The user will certainly be surprised 
 to hear tones when the device is silent — especially if the game is being 
 played in a public place, such as in a church or a school. It should also 
 be noted that some S60 devices might not play the game tones and background 
 music at the same time. </p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">If the 
 game has tones, they should be off by default.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">Inform 
 the users in the help or alongside sound settings that if they have put 
 the device in the silent mode and still hear tones in the game, they need 
 to turn them off in the game settings.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p-CGuideline><p class=Guideline
										style="margin-left: 0in;">Inform 
 the users in the help or alongside sound settings that if they cannot 
 hear background music even if they have turned it on in the game settings, 
 they need to change the device profile from silent to another profile.</p></li>
	</ul>
