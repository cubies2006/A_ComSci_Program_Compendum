<h2>Methods</h2>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Usability testing</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>The only certain way to verify that a user interface 
 works is to test it with real end users. Ultimately, without testing, 
 refining, and retesting the user interface, a developer takes a big risk 
 and will almost certainly produce a final product with serious or even 
 critical usability flaws.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>There are several ways to find out how well the UI works 
 and how to improve it. Listed below are some of the most important and 
 useful ways. Their costs, the work they require, and the results vary, 
 and certain methods are more suitable for particular situations.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Guidelines</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Usability guidelines are a list of recommendations concerning 
 the concept, user interface, and information architecture of mobile games 
 and devices. They have been developed through extensive user testing and 
 provide a way of creating appropriate and consistent products. With guidelines, 
 the most typical usability problems can be avoided.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Expert analysis</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>In expert analysis, a usability specialist evaluates 
 the product from the user’s perspective. The result is a list of potential 
 and existing problems and concrete recommendations for how to develop 
 the product further. Expert analysis can reveal problems that are not 
 covered by the guidelines.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Single-user testing</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>In single-user testing, real end users use the product 
 and are observed by usability analysts in order to find out where they 
 encounter problems and if they use all the features. Single-user testing 
 provides valuable data in a natural context and reveals problems that 
 end users experience.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Group testing</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>The games are tested with a group of users, permitting 
 multiplayer games and more competitive play situations, as well as a more 
 relaxed environment. Group testing is a fast, cost-effective way to test 
 with several users, but it lacks the personal approach of single-user 
 testing.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Satisfaction survey</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Satisfaction surveys provide statistical data in a standardized 
 form, which can be used to evaluate the users' attitudes towards playability, 
 feel of control, and game interest in general. The effect of usability 
 problems on the use experience can be assessed. If used in different phases 
 of development, the impact of changes in the product can be estimated.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>End-user analysis</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>End-user analysis consists of researching market data 
 and user base segmentation and interviewing developers and end users of 
 the product. This helps developers design games to fill the market’s needs 
 and locate possible openings for new product ideas. User groups should 
 be identified at an early phase of the developing process. When the user 
 groups are known, their demands for game development can be specified.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Consulting</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>At times, developers may encounter usability issues about 
 which they hesitate to make decisions. A usability expert can provide 
 valuable insights and help the developer avoid a wrong decision that might 
 prove costly.</p>
