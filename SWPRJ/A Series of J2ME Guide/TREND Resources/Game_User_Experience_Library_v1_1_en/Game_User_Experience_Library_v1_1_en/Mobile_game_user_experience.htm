<h2><span lang=EN-GB>Mobile game user experience</span></h2>

<p class=BodyCopy>These articles and guidelines have been written from 
 the user-experience point of view. User experience is the result of a 
 motivated action in a certain context. The user’s previous experiences 
 and expectations influence the present experience, and the present experience 
 leads to more experience and modified expectations; see the figure below 
 (Mäkelä and Fulton Suri, 2001; Kankainen, 2002).</p>

<p class=InlineBodyText1
	style="text-align: center;"
	align=center><img src="Game_User_Experience_Library_v1_1_en_files/image067.jpg" width="576px" height="199px" border="0" class="img_whs1"></p>

<p class=Caption>Figure: Elements of the user experience </p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Motivated action always happens in a certain context, 
 and this defines the present experience of the user. The context of an 
 experience means the time, people, place, and things that surround the 
 user. For example, watching a good movie in a theatre with good company 
 is very different from watching the same movie at home, alone, in front 
 of a lousy TV.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>A motive is understood here as a need that is driving 
 the user to interact with the game. This need is often emotionally directed. 
 The user has many needs in any situation, but not all of them prompt the 
 readiness to act. Some needs arise from physiological states of tension 
 such as hunger, thirst, and pleasure, and some arise from psychosocial 
 states of tension like the need to enhance self-esteem. A need becomes 
 a motive when it has gained a sufficient level of intensity.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Besides motivational level needs, people have action 
 level needs. Motivational level needs address “why people are doing what 
 they are doing”; action level needs address “how people are doing what 
 they are doing.” Action level needs are cognitive level needs that are 
 related to a mental model of how to conduct an action.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Satisfying the need that motivates a user to interact 
 with a game is not enough to guarantee a positive user experience. Game 
 performance must match or exceed the user’s expectations. User expectations 
 are based on previous experiences, advice from friends and associates, 
 and information and promises from marketers and competitors. If game performance 
 does not match the user’s expectations, the user will be dissatisfied 
 with the product. If performance matches expectations, the user will be 
 satisfied. If performance exceeds expectations, the user will be very 
 satisfied.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Not all product features cause great satisfaction or 
 delight among users, although their absence might be experienced as negative. 
 Moreover, when features that provide great satisfaction become familiar 
 to users, their value may increase. However, in some cases these features 
 may eventually be taken for granted and cease to exceed expectations — 
 these features face value erosion.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Previous user experience can also be a basis for expectations 
 about product performance; therefore, they are mentioned as a separate 
 factor affecting user experience in this conceptual model. This is because 
 previous user experience might increase the user's inclination and readiness 
 to utilize the possibilities of an application in richer ways than in 
 previous use situations. In other words, previous user experience can 
 affect the learning curve for using an application. </p>

<p class=BodyCopy>The following sections will discuss the three elements 
 of user experience — motivation, action, and context — in more detail, 
 and from a game-developing point of view.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Motivation</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Motivation refers to things that direct and energize 
 human behavior. So, why do people play games and what keeps them playing? 
 It is often stated that a good game is fun, challenging, and entertaining. 
 Thus, we presume that these are the motives for playing games: to experience 
 fun, challenge, and entertainment. But what drives people to these three 
 elements?</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Human motivation can be classified into three categories: 
 physiological, cognitive, and social (Wagner 1999, 4). Motivation to play 
 games can be found among the cognitive and social categories, because 
 playing games doesn’t fulfill some physiological need like thirst or hunger. 
 People play games to be thrilled (curiosity), to succeed (achievement 
 motivation), and to interact with others (social motives). Multiplayer 
 games supply additional social motivating factors: interaction, competition, 
 and respect.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Curiosity is a simple motive at first glance — avoiding 
 boredom. However, curiosity is related to seeking the optimal level of 
 arousal for each activity. The level of arousal may be too low or too 
 high. A game continues to arouse curiosity as long as it provides something 
 new. When a game is fully explored, it doesn’t raise the player’s arousal 
 level and playing becomes boring. If the arousal level is too high, it 
 can result in anxiety, irritation, nervousness, or restlessness, and these 
 psychological states may hinder performance. Striking a balance between 
 a challenging game and a frustrating or a boring game is one of the greatest 
 challenges for game designers. The following usability guidelines can 
 help designers minimize needless arousal, so that the game itself provides 
 the challenge.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Achievement motivation (advancing, succeeding) and competition 
 are closely linked. An individual sense of achievement is often reached 
 when competing against others, and a social sense of competition can be 
 reached in a fierce battle against one’s own previous score. The universality 
 of high-score lists indicates how obviously achievement and competition 
 are related to playing games. Games are an excellent channel for gaining 
 a sense of achievement quickly, which is rare in real life. Studying, 
 working, and exercising may provide greater senses of achievement, but 
 only after greater investments. Achievement motivation and competition 
 can be viewed as motives to energize playing and to make people keep playing.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Games fulfill social motives by letting the avatar enjoy 
 respect, love, or power, which the player will feel when really immersed 
 in a game. Multiplayer games bring social concepts into play. Humans are 
 such social beings that the mere presence of others is rewarding. Interacting 
 with others makes people feel they belong to a group and that they get 
 respect from others. Cooperation and competition are two sides of a coin. 
 Being a member of a group requires friendly cooperation, but at the same 
 time there is a constant competition for status within the group. Playing 
 against real people means that power and admiration are at stake.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Curiosity, achievement, and sociality are such broad 
 motives that they can be responded to in many different ways. Garneau 
 (2001) has presented Fourteen Forms of Fun in Gamasutra. These are excellent 
 and concrete examples of how games can respond to the motives presented 
 above. In the table below, these 14 forms of fun are classified according 
 to the motive they respond to. A player's level of arousal can be increased 
 by providing variable game settings to explore and getting emotions involved 
 in playing. Players have a sense of achievement when they see results 
 for their efforts. Sociality can be virtual (love, power) or real through 
 multiplayer mode (competition, social interaction).</p>

<p class=Caption>Table: Garneau’s 14 forms of fun according to different 
 motives</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Action</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Game design is about action (<a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/6714a2e2-ea01-4aeb-9660-e27f435513c5/Single_Player_Games_v1_01.pdf.html"

 “What do the players do and how do they do it?&quot; </p>

<p class=BodyHeading2>Single-player actions</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>In single-player games, users struggle with challenges 
 provided by the game. Basic challenge types in single-player games are 
 physical challenges, puzzles, beating Artificial Intelligence (AI) opponents, 
 and the learning of game-world mechanics. These actions are usually connected 
 to learning (see the table below). </p>

<p class=Caption>Table: Basic challenge types in single-player games</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>For example, when players are beginning to play an action 
 game, they first learn the basic controls. After this, they continue to 
 learn how to use controls efficiently. The players learn which actions 
 are efficient against certain opponents in certain situations, and their 
 reaction times become faster and more reliable. This learning of physical 
 controls is also connected to learning the mental model of the game, since 
 correct use of controls is only possible when the player knows how to 
 correctly interpret the game world and anticipate game actions. </p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Users overcome game challenges with different actions:</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Learning to overcome challenges with these basic actions 
 — that is, trying, sometimes succeeding, and sometimes failing — is an 
 essential part of game design, and has a great effect on the game experience. 
 To ensure a good user experience, basic actions should be intuitive, but 
 they should also be hard to master. For example, game controls should 
 be relatively simple, but mastering them should be difficult. If the challenges 
 are too tough, players will get frustrated. On the other hand, if there 
 is no real challenge, they will be bored.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Game experience and actions should be designed to help 
 players perform these actions and give them the feeling of beating the 
 challenge.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=BodyHeading2>Multiplayer actions</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>In multiplayer games, other players provide the main 
 challenge for the game, by acting with the player. Players beat the challenge 
 cooperatively or try to beat each other. Although the basic actions — 
 moving, thinking and doing — are the same, players need to understand 
 how their own actions affect other players, and how the other players’ 
 actions affect them.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=BodyCopy>In addition, a player may act with other players outside 
 the actual game. Game communities, high-score lists, or discussions with 
 other players about game strategies and tactics can be an essential part 
 of the game experience. The presence of other players has a great effect 
 on the game experience; even simple games like Paper-Rock-Scissors can 
 become interesting if played with a human opponent whose actions other 
 players try to predict.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Examples of possible actions outside the actual game 
 include:</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Designers should design multiplayer game actions that 
 give players the feeling of beating the challenge in interaction with 
 other players.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading1>Context</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Context issues are especially relevant to mobile game 
 applications, since the game-playing environment can vary substantially. 
 Typically, mobile game sessions last less than ten minutes and take place 
 when the user is waiting for something — for the bus to arrive, for a 
 lecture to begin, and so on. Even so, there is great variability: The 
 game can be played outside or inside, under different lighting conditions, 
 and so on. In short, context is the essence of mobility.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading2>Time</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>In general, mobile games (both single- and multiplayer) 
 should be designed for relatively short sessions, since a game can be 
 interrupted at any time, for example by an incoming call. With single-player 
 and two-player mobile games, it is possible to simply save the game, but 
 with games that have more than two players, it is not, since other players 
 may want to continue after one player departs. As a result, multiplayer 
 mobile games should be designed either to be played to completion in a 
 relatively brief period or to be playable in short sessions over time.</p>

<p class=BodyHeading2>Place</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Based on user interviews, the typical scenario for playing 
 a mobile game is when users are waiting. However, users may not remember 
 or take into account all possible situations. Moreover, multiplayer games 
 might bring up new use situations that we are not yet aware of. Even if 
 users do not play in certain places, it may not be because of the environment 
 but, rather, because of the game. If the game uses sounds that can’t be 
 turned off, then game play is limited to places where it is acceptable 
 to make noise.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>A small screen size may make the game difficult to play 
 in certain locations, or the correct keys may be difficult to hit when 
 the user is wearing gloves. A user may not be interested in playing a 
 mobile game at a sports event, but if the game is about the same sport 
 as the event, user motivation may change. A variety of factors affect 
 the environment where games are played.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>The concept of location awareness is beginning to emerge, 
 and it offers numerous possibilities for combining the game world with 
 the real world. Multiplayer games utilizing location-based technologies 
 may give a whole new meaning to &quot;place&quot; in mobile gaming.&nbsp; 
 </p>

<p class=BodyHeading2>People</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Social interaction can be one of the factors that motivate 
 people to play. Mobile devices are predominantly well suited for social 
 playing because of their portability and connectivity. It is easy to pull 
 out a portable game phone and start playing while hanging out with friends. 
 In these situations, the importance of device interconnectivity increases 
 because the challenge and excitement is much greater when playing against 
 a friend than when playing alone (Paavilainen, 2004).</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>A high-score list that allows users to compare their 
 own performance with the performance of others can be very rewarding and 
 motivating. However, an awareness of how other players are performing 
 during the actual game is as important as after the game. When people 
 play together over a wireless network it is very important that they are 
 aware of the game situation, including the status of others. In single-player 
 games the status of the game is easy to communicate to the user, but when 
 more players join the game there is a greater need for the user to know 
 the status of others. Several guidelines in this documentation package 
 address this issue. </p>

<p class=BodyHeading2>Things</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>Several items are necessary in order to play a game. 
 Naturally, there must be a device to play on and a game to play. There 
 must be sufficient power in the battery or a power supply. If the game 
 is played outside and the weather is cold, the battery will run down much 
 more quickly. If the game is intended to be played outdoors, this must 
 be taken into account.</p>

<p class=BodyCopy>There must be a SIM card with certain settings in the 
 device for it to work, and there must be a connection open to use the 
 network. The light must not be so bright that it obscures the screen, 
 and the ambient sound level can’t be higher than the game sounds.</p>
