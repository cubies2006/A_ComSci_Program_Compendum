<img border="0" src="leader.gif" align="left" width="188" height="555">Samuel Sterns' mother told her son that he should become a plumber. 
One day while working as a laborer hauling a load of waste material a gamma ray 
cylinder exploded, and Samuel Sterns became something much more than a plumber. 
It's difficult to say that his mother would be proud of him though. Since that 
day the Leader has spent most of his time trying to take over the world or 
creating more gamma spawned people to do his bidding. He's destroyed entire 
towns and killed thousands of people on his quest to the top.</font></b></P>
