disgruntled Atlantean, but in reality he and his barbarian bretheren are 
outcasts from Atlantis. According to Namor it is the way things have been since 
before time was recorded. So it's easy to understand Attuma's quest for conquest 
of Atlantis. Then one day after Namor had been asked to abdicate his throne a 
civil war broke out. Attuma settled the civil war, but also implanted himself as 
ruler of Atlantis.</font></P>
