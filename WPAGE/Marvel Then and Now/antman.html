              <font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Verdana">Scott Lang was an 
              electronics expert who could not support his family while doing 
              repair work so he turned his talents to burglary. Apprehended, he 
              served his prison sentence and was paroled in three years for good behavior. Lang had furthered his studies of electronics while in 
              prison and soon was hired by Stark International to work in the 
              design department. While employed, he installed the Avengers' 
              defense system where he first met the team. When his daughter was 
              diagnosed as having a serious congenial heart condition, Lang 
              sought the aid of surgeon Dr. Erica Sondhelm, whom he believed to 
              have held prisoner at Cross Technological Enterprises. Desperate 
              to help his daughter, Lang decided to resort to burglary. Breaking 
              into the New Jersey home of Dr. Henry Pym, Lang stole his Ant-Man 
              uniform and shrinking gas canisters. Unknown to him, Pym observed 
              the theft and in his then current guise as Yellowjacket, followed 
              Lang, curious to see what he would do with the paraphernalia. 
              Garbed as Ant-Man, Lang broke into Cross and discovered Dr. 
              Sondheim wan indeed being held prisoner by Darren Cross, president 
              of Cross Technological Enterprises, who need her expertise to 
              correct his heart condition. Rescuing her and defeating Cross, 
              Lang was relieved when Sondhelm was able to save the life of his 
              daughter. Lang intended on returning the Ant-Man costume to its 
              owner and turn himself in, but Henry Pym, aware of the use to 
              which Lang put the stolen goods, offered to let him keep them, 
              providing that he put them to lawful use. </font>

              <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that 
              time, Lang has taken the role of a part time hero. He has fought 
              besides the Avengers, the Wasp, Hawkeye, Iron-Man, Spider-Man, the 
              Fantastic Four. and more. With the vicious take over of Stark 
              International, Lang resigned from the company out of respect for 
              Tony Stark. He has since started his own Electronics service. With 
              the disappearance and believed death of their leader Reed 
              Richards, Susan, his wife, sought Lang to fix and activate the 
              team's Time Machine. Lang stayed on for many months as a regular 
              replacement member. With the help of Kristoff, a young boy 
              brainwashed into believing that he was the true Dr. Doom, Lang 
              obtained a new Ant-Man costume which enabled him to fly as well as 
              granted him with a number of offensive capabilities. With the 
              return of Reed, Ant-Man latter quit the team to spend more time 
              with his daughter. He still runs his Electronics 
              Service&nbsp;freelancing from contractor to contractor. </font>

              Maybe 
              being a classic Avengers fan, but Scott Lang never sat right with 
              me. The original Ant-Man was a biochemist, hence how he discovered 
              the Pym Particles. Lang had no way to produce the gas to make 
              more. As a member of the team, he lacked the cosmic grandeur that 
              the rest of the team possessed. While it was a nice change to see 
              someone fiddle around in Reed's lab, Scott was not Reed. If you 
              want to see some of the best years of Scott Lang, check out the 
              Iron Man series during the Iron Wars, Iron Man issue 225, as well 
              as some of his Avengers appearances, Avengers 278 where he and the 
              Wasp fought Titana and the Absorbing Man.
