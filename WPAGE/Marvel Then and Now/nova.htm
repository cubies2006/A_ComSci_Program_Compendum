<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana color="#FFFFFF">History: Shortly after Frankie Raye’s father died, her 
mother married Professor Phineas T. Horton then known as Thomas Raye. In the 
1940's and 50's, Professor Horton invented the original android Human Torch, but 
the government feared android and future androids would be too dangerous and had 
all of his equipment and chemicals stored in a warehouse. Not long after 
Frankie’s mother married Horton, she did, leaving Horton alone in raising 
Frankie up. During which time, Horton began drinking. After the public saw the 
Human Torch (from the Fantastic Four), Horton became angry that someone was 
using his android’s name and, with his stepdaughter (now 14), broke into the 
warehouse to get his equipment. There, a rotting floorboard gave way, causing 
Frankie to fall and the chemicals she was carrying to catch fire. The flames 
caused by chemicals mutated Frankie, giving her the ability to flame on, without 
burning her body. Horton, overwhelmed by guilt, left her, but first he 
hypnotized her so she would not remember the event, her new powers, or even her 
life with Horton. Every week, Horton sent Frankie money, until a year had passed 
when he sent her a costume and a tape. On the tape she told her to put the 
costume on, then he hypnotized her into not remembering the tape or that she had 
put the costume on. The costume was invisible to the normal eye when underneath 
her costume, and, because of Horton’s hypnotism, Frankie could never see the 
costume.&nbsp;</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana color="#FFFFFF">Then when Frankie saw the Human Torch, she felt an odd 
connection to him. After she dated Johnny Storm for awhile, all her memories 
were restored, and she could now use her powers. She trained with the Fantastic 
Four for awhile, but always wanted something more "cosmic." When Galactus 
returned to earth, Frankie agreed to become his herald, and she was granted the 
Power Cosmic. Now, she was even more powerful and went by the name Nova. She 
served Galactus by leading him to planets, many times populated ones. Later, she 
no longer wants to lead Galactus to populated planets. Galactus dismisses her 
and finds a new herald, Morg, who does not care about other lives. Not agreeing 
with Galactus’s decision, Silver Surfer assembles Galactus’s former heralds and 
attacks Morg. The heralds eventually defeat Morg, but not before Nova dies in 
the battle.</FONT></b></P>

<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana color="#FFFFFF">Height: 5'6"<BR>Weight: 140 lbs.<BR>Eyes: originally blue, 
as Nova, white with no pupils<BR>Hair: originally red, as Nova, none (although 
she has fire that looks like hair)<BR>Other distinguished features: Nova’s 
entire body is covered with cosmic energy resembling flames.</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana color="#FFFFFF">Powers and Abilities</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana color="#FFFFFF">Intelligence: Normal<BR>Strength: Due to her cosmic form and 
metabolism, Nova was far stronger than ordinary human being. If she channeled 
her energy into an act of physical strength, she could lift (press) about 40 
tons. <BR>Flight Speed: Warp Speed<BR>Endurance: Godlike<BR>Durability: 
Metahuman (she wasn't nearly as durable as Norrin)<BR>Reflexes: Enhanced 
Human<BR>Fighting Skills: None<BR>Special Skills and Abilities: 
None<BR><BR>Powers: Nova possessed the ability to manipulate cosmic energy in 
the form of stellar fire. Her entire organic carbon-based body was transformed 
by Galactus to accomodate the nuclear energies that coursed through her. Those 
energies made her the humanoid equivalent a minature sun. Projected from any 
point on her body by mental command, Nova's energies encompassed the entire 
electromagnetic spectrum possessed by a star: heat, light, gravity, radio waves, 
and charged particles. She could produce a maximum amount heat of apparently 
900, 000 degrees Fahrenheit. She was able to produce light of a maximum amount 
of an excess of two times ten to the twenty-fifth power candela. With a minor 
manifestation of her power she could burn through any earthly substance (with 
the exception of Adamantium). She could project a stream of fire resembling a 
solar flare for distances of up to several hundred miles. Nova was able to 
control her cosmic flame to such an extent that she can project a sustained ring 
of flame at a fixed distance around any object. The precise means that Nova 
generated her cosmic flame is unknown. </FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana color="#FFFFFF">Like all of Galactus's Heralds Nova's body was transformed 
to survive all of the conventional rigors of space. As a consequence of her 
cosmic form and metabolism, Nova was far stronger and more durable than an 
ordinary human being. Through she still possessed a physical body it was 
virtually impervious to most froms of physical harm. Any projectile hurled at 
her fiery corona her body automatically incinerated. She was immune to aging, 
disease, and muscle fatigue. She no longer needed air, and was therefore able to 
exist indefinetly in the hard vacumn of space. Nova's major limition was that 
her brain was still organic in function, and still needed occasionally sleep to 
satisfy her human instincts. It was possible that a sever concussion to her body 
could cause her temporary unconciousness, but it took a radical dispersion of 
her body's molecules to kill her. </FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana color="#FFFFFF">By utilizing her power uni-directionally, Nova could fly at 
near light-speed through interstellar space. (Flying at such speeds near 
planetary bodies could cause devastating gravitational disturbances among the 
planets.) Nova was also able to traverse hyperspace with no danger to herself.
