width=315 align=left>Count Nefaria has always been a dangerous individual. As 
head of the Maggia Nefaria was a master strategist. He was a normal man who 
almost managed to turn the entire nation of America against the Avengers. 
Nefaria is supremely confident in himself and his abilities. Money and power 
have been in his family for generations and Nefaria is simply behaving the way 
he feels that he should. Now in addition to the benefits that birth granted him 
Nefaria has manufactured for himself a power that allows him to fight the entire 
team of Avengers. Power, intelligence, confidence. You would think nothing could 
stop this guy...well maybe except those stinking heroes. They always ruin the 
good time.</font></P>
