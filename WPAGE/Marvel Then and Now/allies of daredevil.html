        <p align="justify"><font size="+2">W</font>hile DD and T'Challa don't 
        meet too often, they seem to be good friends and have a lot of respect 
        for each other. The Panther was actually the first hero to figure out 
        DD's identity for sure (Spidey thought he knew even earlier, but then 
        thought he was wrong). And shortly after, he let Matt know that he knew 
        and revealed his own identity. In fact, at one point when a news 
        broadcaster in San Francisco postulated on the air that DD and Murdock 
        were one in the same, T'Challa took on a bad guy in DD's duds while Matt 
        was also there to preserve Matt's identity. The two occasionally call on 
        one another for favors, and due to their similar lack of super powers 
        and their similar skills in gymnastics and unarmed combat, I find that 
        the artists who draw one well seem to draw both well. There's even been 
        a number of occasions on dark nights or in dark alleys where Panther's 
        ears and Devil's horns are confused and people mistake one for the 
        other.</a></td>

        <p align="justify"><font size="+2">T</font>he Black Widow has the unique 
        distinction of being the only super hero that DD &quot;teamed up with&quot; for an 
        extended period of time. From issues in the early #80s through the early 
        #120s, DD &amp; the Black Widow were a team operating out of San Francisco 
        (also the only time DD has operated from somewhere other than New York 
        for an extended period). While there was also a love interest during 
        most of that time, it seems that on Matt's side it may have just been 
        something of a rebound from his relationship with Karen Page. The 
        writers at the time also had Matt treating Natasha rather 
        chauvenistically. Since that time, while the Black Widow has 
        occasionally made it clear that she still feels some affection for Matt, 
        and although Matt has made it equally clear that he wants to remain 
        simply friends, Matt also treats her as an equal now rather than a 
        sidekick whom he must watch out for. While the love angle seems out of 
        the picture, they both hold each other in high regard, both personally 
        and professionally. </p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="+2">T</font>hey occasionally work out or 
        help each other on missions, and there seems to be a natural flow 
        between them that DD doesn't seem to find with anyone else although he 
        comes close sometimes with the Black Panther or Spidey. There is an 
        interesting multi-page workout in DD #121 where DD and the Widow spar 
        with no pulled punches. </p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="+2">E</font>veryone knows that Peter 
        Parker gained his powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. And 
        while both heroes gained their powers due to radioactivity, that's the 
        extent of the similarity between the 2 characters. People often compare 
        the two, or even call DD a &quot;weaker&quot; Spider-Man, but real DD or Spidey 
        fans will tell you most adamantly that the 2 characters are VERY 
        different. This is easy to see if you remember their alter-egos. Matt 
        Murdock is a little older, a little more reserved, more likely to look 
        at various sides of situations, and very concerned with overall 
        pictures. Peter Parker is younger, more impulsive, often sees things as 
        being more black and white. There's even been some animosity between 
        them in the past as DD has been more willing to compromise in situations 
        to attain the &quot;greater good&quot; whereas Spidey is more idealistic. </p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="+2">A</font>nd while they both do a lot 
        of swinging to get around and both have great reflexes and agility, 
        their powers are quite different as well. Spidey tends to rely more on 
        his strength and webs, whereas DD uses his billy club and fighting 
        skills to a greater extent. Spidey relies on his &quot;Spider-sense&quot; to warn 
        him of danger, but Daredevil has to constantly survey his senses, 
        processing the information, and checking his memory to watch for danger 
        or evaluate situations. </p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="+2">C</font>omparisons/differences/similarities 
        aside, when these two get together it's ALWAYS a good issue. For some 
        reason the best in both characters comes out when they help each other 
        out. Possibly because the writers and artists enjoy the two of them 
        together so much. One of my favorite scenes is when Spidey and DD are 
        having a scuffle and Spidey shoots webs over DD's eyes and then smacks 
        himself in the forehead (&quot;Doh!&quot;) as he realizes how useless that was.
