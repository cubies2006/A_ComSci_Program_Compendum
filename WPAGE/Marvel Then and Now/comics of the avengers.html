      </strong><b>Attuma mocks Namor to Marrina. Marrina asks why Attuma doesn't 
      just kill her. Attuma says that Namor will be back, but as soon as he has 
      proof of Namor's death then she may join her beloved into the embrace of 
      death. One of Attuma's soldier tells Attuma that two small forces are 
      moving against them. Attuma orders that they be surrounded and 
      obliterated. Attuma tells Marrina to pray that her rescuers die quickly. 
      The Avengers are defeating Attuma's men, and are then joined by Alpha 
      Flight. Attuma says that he will show Marrina Namor's severed head so she 
      can see his face before dying. One of Attuma's men says that they have 
      lost contact with the two battalions Attuma sent out. Attuma hears the 
      great warning horn signaling that Atlantis is under attack. As both 
      Avengers and Alpha Flight are cutting through Atlantis' forces Attuma 
      orders up the heavy artillery. When he is told it may level the city he 
      says he would level a hundred to insure victory and kill Namor. Namor 
      charges into Attuma. He hits Attuma three times and through a wall. 
      Northstar frees Marrina. Attuma yells for his legions to not let them 
      escape. Attuma's troops surround the Avengers and Alpha Flight. </b> </font>

<FONT style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight:700" face="Verdana" color="#33CCCC">Avengers #23-<img border="0" src="kang2.jpg" align="right" width="265" height="395">Kang watches the twentieth century from his time and sees that Captain 
America has left the Avengers. Kang says that even though his own century 
recognizes him as the most ruthless conqueror of all time the title rings hollow 
so long as the twentieth century escapes his tyranny. Kang recognizes the 
importance Captain America played in the Avengers line up. He says that the 
Avengers are at their weakest and he should strike now. Kang flies over the top 
of Avengers mansion with a flat ship that seems to be the top floor of the 
Avengers mansion as the air force checks out the UFO. Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and 
Scarlet Witch all charge up to the room to see what is happening. They charge 
into Kang’s ship. Kang activates his trap. A flash of light disorients them and 
then they are repeatedly shocked. Hawkeye manages to shoot an arrow through the 
device shocking them. Scarlet Witch notices that there doesn’t seem to be any 
oxygen in there. Hawkeye tries to blast the door open, but another device shoots 
the arrow down before it hits the door. Quicksilver tries to rush the door, but 
collapses before he can knock it down. Kang says that it is fortunate that they 
didn’t get the door open because they are really in a time travel device. Kang 
restores their oxygen because he doesn’t want them to die so soon. Kang says 
that now that he has them hostage in his own time it is time to begin the next 
stage of his plan. Kang storms into the royal palace and demands audience with 
Ravonna. Ravonna says that Kang dare enter without permission and then denies 
him. Kang tells Ravonna to remember that he is the true power, and that if she 
doesn’t watch it he won’t let her rule the universe by his side. Ravonna says 
that she would rather die, but Kang says that too can be arranged. Ravonna’s 
father tells her not to incur Kang’s wrath. Ravonna says even if the universe 
were his she would never share the throne with a commoner. Kang says that he 
could crush them with a fraction of his army, but lets her go because she has 
captured his heart. Kang warns her though that his patience is not as 
inexhaustible as his power. Captain America hears that the Avengers are missing 
and may have met with foul play. He goes after them. Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and 
Quicksilver wake up in Kang’s glass-like prisons. Scarlet Witch uses her hex to 
break the much more powerful than glass cage. She frees the others, but after 
Quicksilver scouts it out they realize that the path they are on leads nowhere. 
Kang’s face appears in the sky and tells them to agree to serve him as all man 
shall, or suffer the consequences. Kang sends his guards after the Avengers. 
Hawkeye shoots three arrows and they all swing over to the opposite side. As 
they swing they are pulled into a wall by Kang’s suction machine. The force is 
too strong for Hawkeye to use an arrow, but he throws an arrow and lets the 
suction pull it into the machine to blow it up. Kang admires their resolve, but 
says he feels sorry for them that they cannot win. Kang tells his guards to back 
off, and then sends the labyrinth the Avengers are in into darkness. Kang shoots 
them with his spectrum-inverter. Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye are paralyzed, but 
Quicksilver’s speed keeps him moving. Suddenly Kang sees Captain America in the 
past shouting at Kang. He tells Kang that his victory is meaningless unless he 
defeats him too. Suddenly Ravonna stands by Kang she asks if the “mighty 
conqueror” will accept the challenge. Kang brings Captain America forward in 
time to show Ravonna his worth. Ravonna guides Captain America’s destination 
location. Kang says he will still win. Kang sends his guards after Cap and 
Quicksilver, but they are defeated. Kang tells them that he has no stomach for 
failures. He says he will deal with the Avengers himself, and that their 
punishment will be swift and severe. Kang goes to his master control room, but 
Cap and Quicksilver attack him there. Quicksilver bounces off Kang’s force 
field. Cap throws his shield, but Kang activates his molecule expander. It 
shoots Cap’s shield back at him, but also causes it to grow to an enormous size. 
Cap dodges the shield and Quicksilver hits Kang. Kang sees that Ravonna and the 
nobles are watching. He blasts Quicksilver and Captain America with his 
spectro-wave knocking them out. Kang says that he demands Ravonna’s answer as he 
has earned it through right of conquest. Ravonna says that the other two 
Avengers will have recovered by now. Kang demands an answer. Ravonna says that 
no one commands a princess. Kang says that his troops surround her kingdom right 
now and that he will conquer her land depending on her answer. Ravonna regrets 
that if only Kang had wooed her with tenderness she would have been his. Her 
father says to think of their subjects, but Hawkeye’s arrow interrupts before 
Ravonna can answer. Kang says, “The die is cast. I shall be merciful no longer! 
Let the fate that befalls be upon all your heads!” Kang signals to his army to 
attack.</FONT></P>
