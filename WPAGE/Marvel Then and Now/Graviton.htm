<H1>Graviton</H1><B>Real Name:</B> Franklin Hall<BR><IMG height=279 
src="Graviton_files/graviton2.jpg" width=100 align=left> <B>First 
appearance:</B> Avengers 158<BR><B>What's His Problem?</B> After a freak 
accident gave him the power to control gravity, scientist Franklin Hall dubbed 
himself Graviton and used his powers to turn a research facility into his own 
little island in the sky, complete with a female colleague as his unwilling 
queen. When the Avengers came to the rescue, Hall easily subdued them with his 
powers but suffered a self-defeating breakdown when his chosen mate tried to 
kill herself rather than remain his slave. Graviton has since recovered, and his 
fatal attraction to power has pitted him against the Avengers time and 
again.<BR><B>Powers:</B> Graviton can mentally manipulate the particles of 
gravitational force for which he is named, increasing or decreasing the force of 
gravity on any person or object, or applying that force in more complex ways for 
flight, manipulation of objects and force fields. In effect, he is one of the 
most powerful humans on Earth.<BR><B>Favorite Quote:</B> "The fundamental forces 
of the cosmos are mine to command! I am gravity's master! Nothing can resist my 
power!" (West Coast Avengers (LS) 4. A taste of typical Graviton 
humility.)<BR><B>Heroes He Keeps Running Into:</B> The Avengers have managed to 
defeat Graviton several times, usually by outsmarting him. He has also battled 
Thor, the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man.<BR><B>People Who Think He's Not So 
Bad:</B> Gravity may be an irresistible force, but the egomaniacal Graviton 
isn't nearly as attractive. He's had various criminal allies, but no real 
friends -- he even murdered his one-time benefactor, The Blank, on a whim. He 
did have the hots for Avengers member Tigra, and she half-reciprocated for a 
while, but she wasn't in her right mind at the time and ultimately turned on 
him.<BR><B>Most Despicable Act:</B> Graviton is into heavy mass destruction with 
attendant loss of life, but one of his meaner moments of petty cruelty came in 
West Coast Avengers (LS) 3-4 when Tigra, Wonder Man and the Shroud infiltrated 
his lair and Grav's accomplice, The Blank, failed to subdue them. An exasperated 
Graviton sent Tigra, Shroud and Blank flying out to their presumed deaths at sea 
and held Wonder Man at the bottom of a pool for hours thereafter so he could 
enjoy watching him drown. All but Blank escaped death, but not for lack of 
trying on Graviton's part.<BR>
