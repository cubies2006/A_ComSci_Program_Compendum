Chandler was born in California as the only daughter with five brothers. When 
she turned 18, her boyfriend, Kenny, got her started in adult films, but she 
later realized she didn’t need adult films to feel good about herself and left 
both Kenny and the adult film industry.</FONT></FONT></P><FONT size=3>
<P align="justify"><FONT face=Arial>Marlo later moved to Las Vegas, where she began a 
relationship with Mr. Fixit, the Gray Hulk. After a while, she ended the 
relationship, being suspicious when the Hulk would turn back into Bruce Banner 
during the day. After Mr. Fixit was fired, she followed him and learned that he 
was the Hulk and married to Betty, who felt like Bruce was cheating on her when 
it was in fact his alter ego.</FONT></P>
<P align="justify"><FONT face=Arial>Marlo then began a relationship with Bruce Banner’s good 
friend, Rick Jones. Later on, though, a woman claiming to be Rick’s mother, who 
wasn’t really, killed Marlo. Rick was driven into a depression and sought the 
help of anyone who could help. The Leader, a villain of the Hulk’s, offered to 
revive her, but was only able to bring her into a deep coma state, before being 
stopped by a mad Hulk.</FONT></P>
<P align="justify"><FONT face=Arial>She eventually awoke and the two were married. They late 
started their own talk show called, "Keeping up with the Jones." Later, Hulk, 
absent of Bruce Banner due to the Onslaught incident, threw Rick Jones against a 
wall, paralyzing him. The incident, along with the death of Betty Banner, caused 
Rick to feel sorry for himself and isolate himself from his wife, causing Marlo 
to leave Rick and his life with superheroes.</FONT></P>
