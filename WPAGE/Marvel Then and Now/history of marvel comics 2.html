    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory6.jpg" align="right" width="275" height="392">Often sentimentalized as 
    complacent, happy days, the 1950's were actually a time of considerable 
    tension in the United States. On the surface, things could hardly have been 
    better. The country had come through the ordeal of World War II 
    comparatively unscathed, and the economy was strong enough to allow generous 
    foreign aid around the world. Yet there were undercurrents of fear and 
    anxiety throughout the land. Conventional wisdom asserted that dropping 
    atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 had saved lives and shortened 
    the war. Nonetheless, over 100,000 people had died in those two blasts. 
    Humanity had acquired the power to eradicate itself. We built underground 
    shelters to protect ourselves and saw flying saucers in the sky. The alien 
    beings inside these ships might be enemies or perhaps they were saviors come 
    to relieve us from the awesome responsibility of policing the planet. In 
    short, the country had the jitters.</font></p>
    <p>

    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory7.jpg" align="left" width="274" height="388">
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Out of this uneasy atmosphere came 
    Marvel Boy (December 1950), Marvel's first and only new super hero of the 
    decade. Marvel Boy was Bob Grayson, an American lad of seventeen raised on 
    the planet Uranus by his father, who had ended up there when this rocket 
    made an unexpected &quot;right angle turn.&quot; Blessed with the powers of strength, 
    speed and mental telepathy, Bob returns to the land of his birth upon 
    learning that &quot;Earth is in a bad way&quot;, then trades in his Uranian flying 
    saucer for an American spaceship.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">All things considered, it's no 
    suprise that the Marvel Boy comic book lasted only two issues. Yet in 1950, 
    Marvel couldn't care less. Like the country, the company seemed strong and 
    fat and happy; nobody felt the trubulence beneath the surface. Financial 
    reverses for Marvel might have been considered a possibility at some point, 
    but not even the wildest imaginations in the business could have dreamed 
    that comic book creators would soon join the Reds and the Martians on the 
    roster of American's enemies, and that the whole industry would be teetering 
    on the brink of doom.</font></p>

    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1950 Gene Colan and his 
    colleagues suddenly found themselves working in a new genre: war comics 
    inspired by the outbreak of the Korean War. During this conflict Marvel 
    began to produce comic books very different from the ones that had been 
    published throughout World War II. The battles deplicted were no longer a 
    matter of super heroes bashing bad guys. Comics now began to show the pain, 
    misery and fear of ordinary soldiers. Perhaps the change stemmed from the 
    experience of writers and artists who had seen combat themselves.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Marvel offered generically titled 
    books like War Comics, Battle, Combat, War Combat, War Action and 
    Battlefront. A few macho heroes were created, notably Combat Kelly (November 
    1951), but the majority of Marvel's comics in the genre emphasized the fact 
    that war was a brutal and bloody business.</font></p>

    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Publisher Martin Goodman's decision 
    to cut back on office overhead and artists salaries had a specific purpose. 
    With comic book production at an all-time high, Goodman decided to mazimize 
    profits by breaking with his distributor, Kable News, and by setting up his 
    own national distributor organization, the Atlas News Company. With the 
    Atlas distribution operation up and running, Martin Goodman suggested that 
    Stan Lee, who had surived the layoff, try a revival of the three top 
    characters for Timely's Golden Age. Super hero stories, once the mainstay of 
    the company, had become virtually the only type of comics that Atlas wasn't 
    publishing. So an experimental comeback ws launched in the twenty fourth 
    issue of an unimportant book called Young Men (December 1953). The highlight 
    of the Atlas super hero revival was Bill Everett's work on his character The 
    Sub-Mariner. The quality of Everrett's improved technique was reflected in 
    the fact that the new Sub-Mariner (April 1954) lasted for ten issues, while 
    The Human Torch and Captain America lasted for only three issues each.</font></p>

    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">The artist who revived Captain 
    America was John Romita, who had begun moonlighting for Marvel in 1951 while 
    he was still serving int the army. By 1953, Romita was out of uniform and 
    ready to take on the challenge of illustration Captain America's new 
    incarnation as a hero for the 1950's. Meanwhile, Jack Kirby and his partner 
    Joe Simon were spoofing such attitudes with Fighting American for Prize 
    Publications. And in fact the gung-ho posture of the new Cap was an example 
    of &quot;too little, too late.&quot; Identifying foreign foes was going out of style. 
    Encouraged by politicians, the country had turned its search for enemies 
    inward. Americans had begun calling each other un-American, and comics were 
    about to take the fall.</font></p>

    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory11.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="359"> </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Fredric Wertham, a New York 
    psychiatrist, was mad at comic books, and he had been for years. A 
    specialist in the treatment of disturbed children and juvenile delinquents, 
    Wertham observed that most of his patients read comic books. He claimed to 
    have determined that comic books were surely detrimental to &quot;mental 
    hygiene,&quot; and that they encouraged children to commit crimes. Armed with a 
    cause, Wertham embarked on a campaign of lectures, public statements and 
    magazine articles that culminated in 1954 with the publishing of a 
    provocative and sensationalistic book. Seduction of the Innocent, Wertham's 
    compendium of half-truths, scared the hell out of a lot of parents. 
    Wertham's major targets were the violent horror and crime comic books that 
    in fact were not appropriate reading matter for younger kids, but to Wertham 
    every comic was a crime comic. Wertham found super heroes especially 
    objectionable, as he told the Senate Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile 
    Delinquency during his testimony in April 1954. Not even love comics escaped 
    Wertham's wrath. He warned that perverts congregated around stores that sold 
    comic books, looking for kids to corrupt. Whatever he might have intended, 
    he set off a furor that nearly killed comic books completely.</font></p>
