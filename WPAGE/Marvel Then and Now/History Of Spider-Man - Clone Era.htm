      household and a sub-plot would be played out for several months before it 
      would go on to become probably the most controversial era in the history 
      of Spider-Man. The sub-plot is exposed at the end of <I>Spectacular 
      Spider-Man </I>#216 where Spider-Man meets none other than Peter Parker? 
      Remember <I>Amazing Spider-Man</I> #149 with the debut and death of 
      Spider-Man's clone? Well, he came back! And it would be twist and turn and 
      twist and turn and twist and turn every other issue in the Spider-Verse 
      for the next two and a half years that would forever change the life of 
      Spider-Man and his world!</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>

      <P align=center>Ben Reilly, the new name of the clone taken from Peter's 
      Uncle Ben and Aunt May's maiden name, took center stage in many issues 
      after his identity was revealed. Of course, if the clone was back, the 
      Jackal couldn't be far behind, and in <I>Amazing Spider-Man</I> #399 he 
      came back. The Jackal wasn't alone though as a slew of characters were 
      born out of the clone Era including Kaine, who turned out to be yet 
      another (failed) clone of Peter Parker's. Dr. Judas Traveller, a seemingly 
      very powerful being who turned out to be not very powerful at all. 
      Spidercide, another clone? Yep! The Scriers, a cult of beings that are 
      seemingly connected to everything that happens in the clone era. There are 
      many other characters in this era and they all played a part in it but a 
      major turning point in the life of the Spider-Men occurred in <I>Amazing 
      Spider-Man</I> #400. Peter's Aunt May dies in that issue in a very 
      memorable story but was brought back a couple of years later by the 
      Mastermind of the clone mess. </P></TD>

      <P align=center>Ben Reilly eventually donned a new costume and life for 
      himself after deciding to stay in New York City. Now known as the Scarlet 
      Spider, Ben became even more popular than Spider-Man at one point and 
      there was that little hint that he was here to stay and maybe even be the 
      real deal! There were many running storylines set in the spider-titles 
      that left it's impact in the clone era including <I>The Mark Of Kaine</I>, 
      <I>Smoke And Mirrors</I>, <I>Players And Pawns</I>, and none more 
      important than <I>The Trial Of Peter Parker </I>where we learn that Ben is 
      indeed the real Peter Parker and that Peter is the clone. <I>Maximum 
      Clonage</I>, where The Jackal's plans and life are finally put to an end 
      set the way for the two Spider-Men to live a Jackal-free life.&nbsp;

      <P align=center>So many things were going on in this period including a 
      new Green Goblin, who this time is a hero. A New Doctor Octopus, a female 
      who replaces the original who was killed by Kaine. The Grim Hunter, son of 
      Kraven and also killed by Kaine. The Scarlet Spider went on to join the 
      New Warriors and the spider-titles ceased publication for a couple of 
      months to make way for similar Scarlet Spider titles. Peter, on the other 
      hand, decided to quit being Spider-Man, and took off with Mary Jane for 
      awhile leaving New York City with one Spider-Man and Ben took advantage of 
      it. In a new title, <I>Sensational Spider-Man</I>, Ben made his debut as 
      the all-new Spider-Man with a new costume, dying his hair blond and 
      accepting a new job at the Daily Grind coffee shop. Everything was fine in 
      the Spider-Verse for the first time in a long time, or was it?&nbsp;
