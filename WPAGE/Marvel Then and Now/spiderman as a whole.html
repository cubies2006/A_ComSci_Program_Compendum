    In the early 60s, a new kind of 
    superhero was created. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had not had his 
    powers from birth. He was a normal person who had, through an accident, 
    gained incredible powers. This meant that he had a life, complete with all 
    of life's problems: money, relationships, secret identity, even school. 
    That's right. He was to be the first teen-aged superhero, Spiderman.</font></b></p>
    <font face="Verdana" color="#000080">
    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when Stan Lee pitched 
    the idea for Spiderman to the editors of Marvel, they were less than 
    enthusiastic. They assured Stan that the entire concept simply wouldn't 
    work. The first problem was his name: Spiderman. Nobody likes spiders. Most 
    people would rather squash a spider than to read about one. Then there was 
    his age problem. Teenagers were not superheroes. Superheroes had already 
    learned about life and had worked through all of the difficulties inherent 
    in being a teenager. Then there was the issue of his personal problems. 
    Superheroes didn't have problems, they solved them. People wouldn't want a 
    superhero who was worrying about paying the mortgage or wondering how he was 
    going to explain why he hadn't completed a homework assignment. People 
    wanted a hero with a squeaky-clean image that everybody looked up to. It 
    seemed that Spiderman was doomed to nonexistence.</b></p>
    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately for the 
    wall-crawler, Marvel was retiring one of its titles, Amazing Fantasy. Since 
    no one at Marvel would really mind what went into the final issue, Stan 
    decided to put the story of Spiderman's creation in. The response was 
    completely unlike anything Marvel had expected. Spiderman became an almost 
    instant success. People looked at Peter Parker/Spiderman as an equal. He, 
    like everyone else on Earth, was a person doing his best to handle 
    everything that life thrust at him. And his powers were a liability to him 
    almost as often as they were an asset. He was a hero who experienced pain, 
    loss, grief and defeat, but never let any of that stop him from doing what 
    he knew was right. While he was saving the city of New York and it's 
    inhabitants from one type of disaster or another, his personal life and the 
    things he most enjoyed doing, had to be sacrificed. People could identify 
    with that aspect of his life and could compare some of the things they had 
    given up for the sake of responsibility.</b></p>
    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, it's hard to imagine a 
    world without Spiderman. In addition to the several comic book titles, three 
    different animated series, two live action television series and a hit 
    movie, Spiderman served as an inspiration, a template, or a launching point 
    for literally dozens of other heroes. Every hero who had to wrestle with his 
    own inner struggles, every hero who was constantly striving for the respect 
    of those he was saving, and every hero who sometimes wished that he had not 
    received his powers, owes a debt to Spiderman. He was the one who showed us 
    that a hero, even a superhero, is still just a person that has to face the 
    same things that each one of us face every day. We are all very fortunate 
    that Stan 'The Man' Lee not only had the vision to dream him, but the 
    perseverance to make sure that the character of Spiderman became a reality.</b></p>
