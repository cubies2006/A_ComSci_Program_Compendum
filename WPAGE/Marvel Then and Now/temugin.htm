<img border="0" src="temugin.gif" align="right" width="505" height="542">Temugin is the son <BR>of the Mandarin. <BR>He has precious few 
<BR>memories of his father <BR>and most of them <BR>involve his father 
<BR>taking him to the <BR>monastary where he <BR>was raised and trained. 
<BR>Finally one day, Temugin <BR>received a package <BR>containing the hands 
<BR>of the Mandarin. <BR>The hands bore all the <BR>rings of power and 
<BR>Temugin knew that he <BR>was honor bound to <BR>fulfill his father's wishes 
<BR>for him. Temugin has already <BR>had measured success <BR>against Iron Man 
defeating <BR>him without the aid of any <BR>of the rings of power <BR>(Temugin 
thought that they <BR>gave him an unfair advantage).</font></P>
