<H1>Goliath</H1><B>Real Name:</B> Erik Josten<BR><IMG height=237 
src="Goliath_files/goliath1.jpg" width=267 align=right> <B>AKA:</B> Power Man. 
Smuggler. Atlas<BR><B>First Appearance:</B> Avengers 21 as Power Man; 
Spectacular Spider-Man 49 as Smuggler; Iron Man Annual 7 as Goliath; Incredible 
Hulk 449 as Atlas<BR><IMG height=416 src="Goliath_files/goliath.jpg" width=145 
align=left> <B>What's His Problem?</B> As his original alias hints, Erik Josten 
has a thing for power. The immortal Enchantress used Baron Zemo's machines to 
turn him into the super-strong Power Man. Josten conspired against the Avengers 
with her only to be abandoned by the Enchantress when the going got tough. None 
the wiser for his experience, Josten spent the ensuing years in pursuit of 
criminal gain, usually in the employ of various criminal masterminds. One such 
mastermind, Count Nefaria, tricked Josten into letting Nefaria drain away much 
of his power for Nefaria's own use. He continued his criminal career in more 
covert fashion as the Smuggler before becoming the powerful (and really tall) 
Goliath. Despite his newfound might, the Avengers and other heroes have defeated 
Josten time and again. Perhaps tiring of this, Josten assumed the new alias of 
Atlas and joined several other disguised super-criminals in forming the 
super-heroic Thunderbolts team, and became one of a splinter group trying to 
become <I>real</I> super-heroes. <BR><B>Powers:</B> Goliath, like the late 
Avengers member Wonder Man, has phenomenal superhuman strength and durability 
thanks to <A 
href="http://www.geocities.com/marvel_villains/zemo/zemo.html">Baron Zemo's</A> 
ionic ray process. By growing to giant size Josten augments his strength even 
further. He is almost unbeatable on a physical level. His physical size is 
potentially limitless, but he risks mental or physical collapse if he grows 
beyond sixty feet, and has gotten stuck a few times at that height. Like Wonder 
Man, Goliath may also have other latent superhuman powers that will gradually 
surface over time.<BR><B>Favorite Quote:</B> "I've been used all my life. Power 
Man was always somebody's flunky! But I'm not Power Man anymore. I'm Goliath. 
And where Goliath walks -- he walks alone!" (Iron Man Annual 7). <I>Funny 
statement from someone who claims to be a chain of command guy in Thunderbolts! 
editor these-things-bother-me Jeanne.</I><BR><B>Heroes He Keeps Running Into: 
</B>Josten has been battling the Avengers for years, both alone and as a member 
of Mandarin's Minions, the Lethal Legion and the Masters of Evil. Heroes who've 
given Goliath the slingshot treatment include Captain America, Spider-Man, Iron 
Man, Wonder Man, Hawkeye and Mockingbird.<BR><B>People Who Think He's Not So 
Bad:</B> The Enchantress thought Josten was kinda cute, though not cute enough 
to risk her neck over. Josten's also had a few recurring criminal buddies, like 
fellow Lethal Legion alumni Swordsman and Man-Ape, and is a team player by 
inclination despite his occasional delusions of grandeur. The current Baron Zemo 
calls him by his first name, a definate sign of favoritism. As one of the more 
affable Thunderbolts, Josten has earned the respect of his teammates and the 
admiration of the masses, most notably New York City's mayoral assistant Dallas 
Riordan, with whom he's begun a romance as Atlas.<BR><B>Most Despicable Act:</B> 
Goliath was among the Masters of Evil who invaded and occupied Avengers Mansion; 
during the occupation, he and several other Masters beat Hercules nearly to 
death. <I>Y'know, stuff like this is why I have trouble buying the idea of a 
more "affable" Goliath -- editor Jeanne</I><BR>
