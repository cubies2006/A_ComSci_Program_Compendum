<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>History: Mantis was the daughter of Gustav Brandt who fought 
in Indochina as a mercenary soldier, and his wife Lua, the sister of Monsieur 
Khrull, leader of a local underworld organization. Khrull despised Europeans and 
was therefore infuriated by his sister's marriage. He was determined to kill 
both her and her husband. As a result the Brandt's fled from one Indochinese 
village to another for nearly ten months. Towards the end, Mantis was born, and 
the Brandt's decided to stop fleeing, but to remain in hiding.</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>Nevertheless, Khrull and his men found them and used 
flame-throwers to set their home ablaze. Lua was killed. Badly burned and 
blinded, Gustav escaped with his infant daughter, who was unharmed. They both 
fled for days until they reached the temple of the Priests of Pama, a pacifistic 
sect of the humanoid alien Kree who established temples on various worlds to 
escape Kree persecution. Because he was a soldier, the pacifistic Priests 
separated Brandt from his daughter so that they could raise her in their more 
peaceful ways. They tried to teach Brandt their philosophy as well, but 
succeeded only in teaching him how to "see" despite his blindness, presumably by 
psychic means.&nbsp;</FONT></b></P>
