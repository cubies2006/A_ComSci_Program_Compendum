  <P><B>Plot</B>: <I>In the Valley of the Tombs in Siam, the archaeological 
  expedition of Professor John Malcolm uncovers the tomb of The Scorpion. Radio 
  broadcaster Billy Batson is accompanying the group but decides to respect the 
  Feuer. warnings against all interlopers on the tomb. For his respect an 
  ancient figure appears and bestows a gift on Billy - he has to merely say the 
  word ‘Shazam’ and he is transformed into the superheroic Captain Marvel. The 
  others uncover a golden scorpion with lenses that when arrayed can project a 
  disintegrating ray or else transform metal into gold. It is decided that this 
  discovery is too dangerous and so the lenses are distributed among the five 
  scientists of the expedition for safekeeping. But back in the USA the masked 
  villain known only as The Scorpion comes after the scientists to get the 
  lenses. It is up to Billy, in the form of Captain Marvel, to stop The Scorpion 
  and his men. But then Billy realizes that The Scorpion is really one of the 
  five scientists.</I>

  <P>Captain Marvel was always a ripoff of DC’s Superman. The Captain first 
  appeared in <I><FONT color=#cc0000>Whiz Comics #2</FONT></I> in February 1940, 
  only two years after Superman had premiered. The character’s unique spin was 
  that he was always a young boy until he said the words Shazam, an anagram 
  comprised of the names of the great heroes and gods - Solomon, Hercules, 
  Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury - whose powers he would then inherit. Unlike 
  Superman, Captain Marvel’s writers didn’t take themselves very seriously - at 
  one point Captain Marvel had a talking rabbit Hoppy as companion and was 
  battling a world-conquering intergalactic villain who was finally revealed to 
  be a worm. Captain Marvel was highly popular - there were various spinoffs 
  such Captain Marvel Jr, The Marvel Family, with Hoppy even appearing in his 
  own comics, and then this serial which was made only a year after the comic 
  premiered. But in 1946 DC Comics decided to sue Fawcett Publications, alleging 
  that Captain Marvel infringed the Superman copyright. A protracted legal 
  battle began, ending with Fawcett deciding to cancel the Captain Marvel line 
  in 1953. But in a bizarre turnaround DC then brought the rights to Captain 
  Marvel and launched their own Captain Marvel line of comic-books between 
  1973-6 entitled <I><FONT color=#cc0000>Shazam</FONT></I> (so as to avoid 
  confusion with Marvel’s unrelated superhero series also entitled <I><FONT 
  color=#cc0000>Captain Marvel</FONT></I>). Captain Marvel later appeared in a 
  live-action tv series, <I><FONT color=#cc0000>The Shazam/Isis Hour</FONT></I> 
  (1974-6) where he was played by John Bostwick in the first season and John 
  Davey in the second. 
  <P><I><FONT color=#cc0000>Adventures of Captain Marvel</FONT></I> is often 
  spoken of as one of the best of all the serials. It’s not quite, or at least 
  if it is that may say something about the impoverished quality and production 
  values most serials were made under. Certainly <I><FONT color=#cc0000>Captain 
  Marvel</FONT></I> is the most superheroic that serial superheroes were ever 
  allowed to get. The film throws in a series of quite dynamically directed 
  shots with Tom Tyler diving and forward-rolling into the action, which are 
  combined with flying model shots and back-projected footage (most of which are 
  repeated several times over). Crucially though this Captain Marvel’s 
  superherodom never extends much more than that - in one scene he rescues 
  several people from a car that has gone off a bridge into the river but 
  mundanely carries them out one at a time, whereas with any modern superhero 
  you would expect him to lift the whole car out; in another scene he and Louise 
  Currie are tied up on a bombing range and he merely carries her away to 
  shelter behind a rock while the hut blows up behind them, instead of as one 
  might imagine flying away to safety with her in his arms. This is the most 
  superheroic that superheroes of the era ever got - a few jumps, a couple of 
  back-projected flight scenes and maybe one instance of super-strength - not 
  even the well-remembered <I><FONT color=#cc0000>The Adventures of 
  Superman</FONT></I> tv series (1953-8) rose above this imaginative 
  impoverishment. There is the odd moment that raises some eyebrows today - in 
  one scene Captain Marvel turns a machine-gun around and wipes out a horde of 
  natives, in another he throws a villain off a rooftop. Certainly one quite 
  decent aspect is the alter ego, even if it is only a far less complex copy of 
  the Superman/Clark Kent dichotomy. Frank Coghlan Jr makes a convincingly 
  geekish and nasally ingenuous Billy; while the hawk-faced Tom Tyler makes a 
  suitably intense and heroically profiled Captain Marvel. 
  <P>There are some decent cliffhangers and death-traps - one where Captain 
  Marvel is trapped on an electrified conveyor belt that is taking him toward a 
  guillotine; a hidden panel which swings machine-guns into action to target 
  interlopers; an excellent special effect with the hoods using the 
  half-completed lens to melt the entire mountain; and a quite decently 
  sustained sequence where the crew of a sinking ship are ferried to shore in a 
  set of breeches. As with all serials there are aspects of the plot that are 
  contrived - people deciding to have meetings at mines, Louise Currie racing 
  off to try and trace the serial number of a truck, Billy deciding to fly to a 
  meeting in his own plane - which are there for no other reason than to extend 
  the plot and create cliffhangers. It all makes for a passably decent serial, 
  but hardly a classic. <!-- Please give me one more edit --><BR>&nbsp;
