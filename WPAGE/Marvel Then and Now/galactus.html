        <b>Powers: Possessed of cosmic power far beyond human imagining, 
        Galactus is able to rearrange matter, project force blasts, teleport 
        vast distances and erect forcefields. A telepath, he can connect to any 
        mind with which he comes in contact.</b></font></p>

        <br>
        A fundamental force of nature on a ceaseless search for sustenance, his 
        eons-old legend spans the width and breadth of the very cosmos. From the 
        Skrull homeworld to Shi'ar space, his name is whispered with fear under 
        cover of darkness -- for depleting a planet's life-sustaining energies 
        is all that can satiate the awesome hunger of Galactus, devourer of 
        worlds!</b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">
        <b>History: Galan -- the being who would become Galactus, sole survivor 
        of a dead universe -- was born on the planet Taa, home to the most 
        advanced civilization in all the stars. But as the world's humanoid 
        population ascended to the pinnacle of prosperity, scaling heights 
        rarely dreamt of since the dawn of creation, creation itself stood on 
        the verge of collapse. The dense sphere of planet-forming, primordial 
        matter propelled outward billions upon billions of years before by the 
        force of a cataclysmic Big Bang had begun to recede, with equally 
        catastrophic results. Taa's civilization was one of the last remaining, 
        and lethal radiation had decimated the planet's population.</b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">
        <b>Galan, a space explorer, was dispatched to scour the cosmos for a 
        means of salvation. Grasping the inevitability of his planet's demise, 
        he proposed that Taa's survivors meet death on their own terms -- in a 
        glorious fashion befitting the grandeur of their fallen homeworld. Galan 
        led his people's exodus via starship into the Cosmic Egg at the heart of 
        the dying universe, the centralized collection point for the shape and 
        substance of untold worlds. As the vessel approached its final 
        destination, its crew began to succumb to the lethal effects of 
        radiation poisoning. But the sentience of the dying universe spared 
        Galan the fate of his fellow passengers. They both would die, the entity 
        revealed, only to be born anew. The Cosmic Egg absorbed Galan into 
        itself -- bringing into being Galactus, insatiable ravager of worlds.</b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">
        <b>Time passed beyond reckoning. Hurled outward in Galan's recreated 
        starship by the force of a second Big Bang, Galactus drifted for eons as 
        life began to flourish. Arisen from the ashes of a dead universe, 
        Galactus discovered that he could survive only by visiting a similar 
        fate upon other unsuspecting planets. Consuming their raw energies, he 
        would leave them lifeless and barren. Galactus constructed an immense, 
        planet-sized ship called Taa II to carry him forth on his quest. Though 
        at first compassionate enough to devour only uninhabited worlds, 
        survival dictated he could not be so fastidious.</b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">
        <b>Galactus sowed the seeds of his eventual downfall when he threatened 
        the planet Zenn-La, home to a highly advanced race of humanoid being. 
        One of the orb's inhabitants, Norrin Radd, persuaded Galactus to spare 
        Zenn-La in exchange for his servitude. As Galactus' herald, Radd would 
        seek out uninhabited worlds for his master to consume. And so Galactus 
        transformed Radd into his Sentinel of the Spaceways: the Silver Surfer.</b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">
        <b>Eventually, however, Galactus grew determined to consume the 
        energy-rich planet Earth. The Surfer rebelled, and elastic inventor Reed 
        Richards of the legendary team of adventurers known as the Fantastic 
        Four thwarted Galactus under the threat of an alien device called the 
        Ultimate Nullifier -- powerful enough even to eradicate the ravager of 
        worlds. Galactus was forced to spare Earth, but he punished his 
        insubordinate herald by erecting an energy barrier that prevented the 
        Surfer from leaving the planet.</b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">
        <b>Despite his pledge to Richards, Galactus returned on several 
        occasions to consume Earth. Always, the planet's costumed champions 
        narrowly diverted his appetites. Meanwhile, Galactus devoured numerous 
        inhabited worlds throughout the known universe to slake his hunger. His 
        legend spread across the cosmos, and Galactus became feared as a menace 
        to all star-faring races. Preceding one of his many attempts to destroy 
        Earth, he had gone so long without feeding that his energies were 
        severely depleted. Before his life force ebbed entirely, Richards 
        delivered him from death's door. The grateful Galactus pledged his 
        friendship to the scientist and promised never to attack Earth again.</b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">
        <b>However, he continued to prey upon other inhabited worlds, and the 
        universe trembled before his awesome might. Believing Galactus to be out 
        of control, galactic forces united to halt his reign of terror. During a 
        battle led by Earth's heroes, Galactus finally was felled. As he lay 
        dying, he told the Surfer that he had allowed himself to be destroyed so 
        he could gain the means to do what must be done in the future. He then 
        warned his former herald that his death was only the beginning, and that 
        a greater horror and purpose remained to come. The once-mighty 
        world-devourer perished, but his energies lived on in the shape of a 
        star -- apparently the true form of Galactus.</b></font><p align="justify">&nbsp;<p align="center">
