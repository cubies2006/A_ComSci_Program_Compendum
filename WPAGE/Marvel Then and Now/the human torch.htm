<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="torch.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="463">The reclusive but brilliant scientist and inventor Professor Phine as 
Horton is trying to create "a synthetic man--an exact replica of a human being" 
which bursts into flames when exposed to air. Horton succeeds in doing so, but 
when the android is activated and gains digital (or is it perhaps analogue?) 
consciousness, he breaks free of Horton's control and decides to become a 
crimefighter. He adopts the identity of Jim Hammond and begins a successful 
career as a superhero. In the course of one case he discovers a circus boy who 
had a mysterious natural immunity to fire; Hammond took the boy on as his 
sidekick Toro. 
In late 1948 Toro disappeared, and the Human Torch (I) took on a new sidekick, Sun Girl. 
The Torch had adventures through 1949, when his comic book was cancelled, and 
then again in 1954, during the brief heroic revival of that year. And then the 
Torch disappeared. </font> 
<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the Silver Age the Human Torch (I) was brought back, in <I>Fantastic Four 
Annual</I> #4. As it stands now, in current Marvel continuity, the Human Torch's 
history is this: the Torch's origin is the same, as are the circumstances under 
which he met Toro. During the war itself the Torch and Toro were members of the Invaders. 
At the end of the war the Torch and Toro broke into Hitler's bunker and fried 
him, killing his body (but not his consciousness). The Torch then went on to 
fight crime with the All-Winners Squad 
during the late 1940s. In 1949, after the All-Winners Squad broke up, criminals 
doused the Torch and Toro with a chemical formula. This neutralized their powers 
and paralysed the Torch, and the criminals, thinking Toro no threat to them, 
left him behind and buried the Torch in the Nevada Desert. </font> 
<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In December 1953 an atomic bomb test renewed the Torch's powers and freed him 
from his paralysis, and he reunited with Toro and went back to fighting crime. 
In 1955 the radiation to which he'd been exposed caused the Torch to malfunction 
and lose control of his flames, and he said goodbye to Toro, went back to the 
desert, and attempted suicide by overloading his body with one massive burst of 
flames. This rendered him comatose and inert. </font> 
<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><I>Then</I>, in the modern era, he was revived yet again, after various 
events ending up stripped of power and working for Oracle, Inc., the company 
owned by Namor, and helping 
to run Heroes for Hire. Most recently he was handed control of the V-Battalion.
</font> 
<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, in <I>Avengers Forever</I>, Kurt Busiek established that the Human 
Torch (I) was used to make the modern hero the Vision (II), with the Heroes for 
Hire Jim Hammond being a "chronally divergent" version of the Torch. <BR></font><BR>
