<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="goliath1.gif" align="left" width="494" height="599">Erik Josten, mercenary, attempted murderer, smuggler, 
scourge of the Avengers, hero? That's right. Goliath's entry on this page is 
merely wishful thinking on my part. The man who once beat Hercules into a coma 
is now a hero, a Thunderbolt. The only reason my hope for Erik Josten's return 
to a life of crime might not be a pipe dream is because Erik views himself as a 
traitor, as a betrayer. Erik feels he betrayed his sister, causing her death. He 
betrayed the army by becoming a smuggler and going A.W.O.L. He betrayed, the man 
who saved his life, Baron Zemo by joining up with the other renegade 
Thunderbolts. He also feels he betrayed his teammateds helping Zemo escape 
justice because he felt guilty for turning on Zemo, a man he swore his life to. 
Josten true to form is keeping secrets from his teammates right now. Will his 
constant betrayal lead to the Thunderbolts' undoing. If you're a fan of villainy 
in comics you had better hope so.</font></P>
<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana">"But when I was pounding on Gravitron , I felt it again-the same kind of 
thrill, the rush I used to get from fighting when I was crazy. I gotta face 
facts, kid. For all my power, I'm weak- -weak-willed, weak-minded- -an' the rest 
of you guys-you probably shouldn't trust me."- Erik Josten, Thunderbolts #18
