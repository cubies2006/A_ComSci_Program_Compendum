    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bullseye is insane. He is a sociopathic, psychopathic, 
      sicko! He had a brain tumor at one point which had him hallucinating that 
      <I>everyone</I> was Daredevil, but whether or not the brain tumor was part 
      of the cause of his aberrent behavior may never be known. He can turn 
      anything into a weapon, and has unnaturally superb aim. One of the best 
      assassins in the world, he couldn't beat Daredevil. In fact, with one 
      exception, every time Daredevil and Bullseye have fought, DD has come out 
      on top. Bullseye has developed a major hate for DD (I think mostly because 
      of this losing streak). It's almost as if he goes into a confrontation 
      with DD already saying, "You always beat me! It's not fair!" </p>
      <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very little is known about his background. There was a mention 
      somewhere about his being in the military and also possibly a ballplayer?? 
      Daredevil ended up dropping him and paralyzing him once, but after some 
      combination high tech and oriental medicine (not to mention an infusion of 
      unbreakable adamantium into his bones), he got better. This is someone you 
      don't want to be in the same city with.
      <P align="justify"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: Bullseye is often listed as having his first appearance in 
      Nick Fury #15 (1969). From everything I can tell, this is a completely 
      different character with a different origin &amp; abilities.</i>

      <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gladiator started off as a strong man seeing that people only got ahead 
      when they took what they want and why should all those super heroes have 
      all the glory anyway. A talented costume designer, he put together an 
      outfit with very nasty wrist blades, to go out and conquer with. After 
      some time, apparently he saw the world as an arena and his fights as 
      contests in the old Roman style. [Personally I liked his initial 
      motivations better than this "fantasy world" he supposedly ended up living 
      in.] He got some counseling from his wife-to-be Betty Beatty and nowdays 
      is a friend of Daredevil's. His wife means everything to him, and at one 
      point Daredevil helped rescue her when she'd been kidnapped to try to 
      force Gladiator back into a life of crime. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Mr. Fear might be the most obvious choice for arch-nemesis for 
      the "Man Without Fear", the Kingpin is the best arch-enemy for Daredevil 
      when you look at his beliefs and values. While Matt Murdock holds justice 
      and the rights of the individual to be paramount, Wilson Fisk sees the 
      whole world as one big game, a system to be manipulated, and the 
      "individuals" are no more than game pieces to be toyed with or disposed of 
      without any further thought. The Kingpin's only weakness used to be his 
      wife Vanessa for whom he'd do almost anything. It's interesting to note 
      that at one point he was going to retire from crime to the life of a spice 
      merchant, but this all fell apart when Vanessa was kidnapped coming to 
      engage the services of Nelson and Murdock to help the Kingpin legitamitize 
      his affairs. Ironic that later, Murdock and the Kingpin would become such 
      bitter enemies. At first, the Kingpin never even noticed Daredevil as 
      anything other than a minor annoyance, but shortly after he discovered 
      Daredevil's identity, he decided that he wanted to "break" the man called 
      Matt Murdock. He destroyed Matt's life in every way and was going to kill 
      him, but Matt survived. Daredevil became an obsession of the Kingpin's 
      after this. In fact, "Daredevil" was one of the only things that could 
      break the Kingpin's cool, calm, collected outlook. Daredevil then proceed 
      to tear down the Kingpin's empire and the Kingpin wandered homeless for a 
      while, although there have been hints in the Marvel Universe that he may 
      be coming back!
      <P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While people often refer to the Kingpin as the "fat man", he isn't. He 
      is solid as they come, and deceptively fast for his size. He tends to 
      scatter the best fighters as if they were bowling pins. However, as far as 
      I'm aware he has no "super powers". </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
