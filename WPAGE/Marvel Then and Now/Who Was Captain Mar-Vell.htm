<P align=center><U><BIG><STRONG><FONT face=Arial><BIG>The History of Captain 
Mar-Vell</BIG></FONT></STRONG></BIG></U></P>
<P><IMG height=176 src="Who Was Captain Mar-Vell_files/capt_mar_02.gif" 
width=180 align=left><FONT face=Arial>The Kree were a technologically-advanced 
empire which spanned many different star systems, ruled by an an incredibly 
advanced sentient collective intelligence known as the Supreme Intelligence. The 
Supreme Intelligence (or Supremor) was a repository of the sum of all Kree 
advancement and knowledge, and was almost worshipped as a living god by the 
rigid, militaristic, and extremely bellicose Kree society. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The Kree had forgotten about a small outpost, manned by the 
solitary Sentry #459. This outpost was discovered by the Fantastic Four, and the 
defeat of not only the Sentry but also Ronan the Accuser (a high Kree official) 
marked this little backwater planet as something to be watched. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>An espionage unit commanded by Colonel Yon-Rogg and 
consisting of Captain Mar-Vell and Medic Una (who is a member of a Kree pacifism 
cult). Mar-Vell and Una are lovers, and Mar-Vell is hated by his commanding 
officer not only for reasons of professional jealousy but for reasons of 
romantic jealousy. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Mar-Vell assumes the identity of Dr. Walter Lawson, one of 
the chief scientists at the Cape Canaveral missle complex. He is watched by the 
head of security, Carol Danvers, as he tries to balance his duty to the Kree and 
his aversion to letting innocents die. Mar-Vell is coming to really like his 
adopted planet. Mar-Vell fights such villains as the Super-Skrull, Quasimodo, a 
killer robot Cyberex built by the original Walter Lawson, the Aakon (alien 
enemies of the Kree), and the Man-Slayer. Medic Una is killed by a stupid plot 
of Yon-Rogg's, and Mar-Vell vows to have vengence. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Mar-Vell is granted powers by a cosmic entity named Zo, but 
it soon becomes clear that Zo is an illusion, masking a conspiracy by Ronan the 
Accuser and Zarek the Imperial Minister against the Supreme Intelligence. They 
wish to overthrow the Supreme Intelligence and establish a regime in which the 
racially pure Blue Kree can purge the Empire of the 'corrupted' non-blue Kree. 
Mar-Vell defeats their efforts, and the Supreme Intelligence rewards Mar-Vell by 
making those powers permanent and giving him a new costume. However, he is 
trapped in the Negative Zone by Yon-Rogg. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Enter Rick Jones, who has left his partnership with Captain 
America. Led by illusions, he discovers a forgotten alien base, wherein he finds 
a pair of Nega-Bands. Donnign these, he discovers that by slamming them together 
he and Mar-Vell may switch places. Mar-Vell and Rick fight Yon-Rogg, who dies 
shortly thereafter. Rick begins a career as a pop-singer, managed by a promoter 
named Mordecai P. Boggs. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Rick and Mar-Vell travel around Earth, and become involved 
in the Kree-Skrull War, and Rick taps into the inherent genetic 'greatness' 
which puts an end to the War. At the end of the War Mar-Vell merges with Rick to 
save his life, and is apparently lost, but later it is revealed that Mar-Vell 
and Rick are doing the Negative-Zone bit again. </FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=246 src="Who Was Captain Mar-Vell_files/capt_mar_01.jpg" 
width=200 align=right><FONT face=Arial>Mar-Vell and rick travel around the 
country, with Rick reluctant to let Mar-Vell out from the Negative Zone. They 
fight such menaces as Megaton the Atomic Assassin and Dr. Mynd as they wait for 
the greatest battle of Mar-Vell's career - the fight against Thanos.&nbsp; 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The Thanos War consumes Mar-Vell and Rick's existence as 
they battle Thanos' minions - various renegade aliens, the Super-Skrull, the 
Collector, and myriad others. Mar-Vell is joined in this fight by Mentor 
(Thanos' father) and Eros (Thanos' brother), Moondragon, Drax the Destroyer, and 
the Avengers. He is made 'Cosmically Aware' by the entity Eon, and declared by 
Eon the Protector of The Universe. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Ultimately Mar-Vell and his allies defeat Thanos and his 
minions. Mar-Vell returns to earth, where he faces Nitro, and is exposed to 
carcinogens which will ultimately kill him. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Next, Mar-Vell begins to encounter the agents of the Lunatic 
Legion, who send andriods to defeat him. Mar-Vell traces the Lunatic Legion to 
the Blue City on the moon. The Lunatic Legion is a conspiracy of blue Kree 
high-ranking military officers such as Admiral Sro-Himm, Zarek, and Fer-Porr. 
They have obtained assistence from the Watcher, who undergoes a trial for his 
interference in the affairs of others and is adjudged guilty. Mar-Vell travels 
to the Kree homeworld where he finally defeats Ronan the Accuser and the Lunatic 
Legion. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>On his way back he encounters the Stranger and is attacked 
by Drax the Destroyer (a recurring theme in Mar-Vell's existence, it seems....). 
He helps the underground of Deneb IV against the Null-Trons, killer Kree robots. 
He is later captured by the Supreme Intelligence, who is trying to absorb Rick 
Jones to gain those supra-abilities with which Rick defeated the entire Kree 
Empire during the Kree-Skrull War. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Mar-Vell and Rick returned to Earth, just in time to defeat 
the Kree Sentry #459 and his partner, the Cheetah. When he collapses at the end 
of the battle (well, OK....after he escapes from incarceration in a Sheriff's 
office), he is captured by Mac-Ron, and does battle with Ronan the Accuser. 
Ronan succumbs to a viral disease which reduces him to a childlike condition, 
and he and Mac-Ron are stranded on Earth. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Mar-Vell then helps the Avengers defeat the Super-Adaptoid, 
and in the process separates himself from Rick Jones. Rick goes off to pursue 
his own life (for a change), and while Mar-Vell foils the invasion plans of 
Mercurio the 4-D Man, Rick is captured by Dr. Minerva, who desires to mate with 
Mar-Vell so that Kree genetics can transcend that dead-end they've been in for 
the last millenia or so. When Mar-Vell returns he is confronted by Minerva, but 
before she can consumate her plans (heh), the head of the Kree Science Council, 
Phae-Dor, takes control of her vessel and uses an energy-manifestation to try 
and capture Mar-Vell for use by the Kree in the War Of Three Galaxies. Mar-Vell 
and the Inhumans deal with the War, and Mar-Vell returns to Earth once again. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>After a short period where he fights Nitro and Deathgrip, he 
is attacked by Drax the Destroyer, who is somewhat enraged that he has no 
purpose - he blames Mar-Vell for the death of Thanos, and attempts to destroy 
Mar-Vell in revenge. Mar-Vell brings together a temporary truce when they 
discover that Thanos has programmed ISAAC, the master computer system of Titan, 
to continue his plans in the event of his death. Mar-Vell and Drax proceed to 
Titan. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Most of the Titans have been captured by ISAAC, and Mar-Vell 
frees Mentor and Eros, and battles Lord Gaea, Dionysus, Elysius (who changes her 
mind about working with ISAAC when she falls in love with Mar-Vell), Stellarax, 
and Chaos. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>After the defeat of ISAAC and his minions, Mar-Vell and 
Elysius tour Earth together, in what Mar-Vell refers to as "it was a honeymoon 
of sorts". They retire to Titan for a time, until Mar-Vell discovers that he has 
a problem. </FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=300 src="Who Was Captain Mar-Vell_files/funeral_sm.jpg" width=194 
align=left><FONT face=Arial>Titans call it "The Inner Decay". The Kree call it 
"The black-end". We Terrans call it "cancer". </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>When Mar-Vell defeated Nitro and sealed the leaking 
cannister of a deadly bio-agent, he contracted cancer. Unknown to him, his 
nega-bands kept the cancer in remission until the cancer mutated beyond its 
ability to affect, and by the time it was detectable by Mar-Vell it had mutated 
past a cure. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Mar-Vell was awarded the Royal Skrull Medal of Valor before 
his death by General Zedrao in recognition of his bravery, as a token of respect 
to their enemy. The Kree rejected Mar-Vell even in death. Mar-Vell was 
posthumously made an Avenger. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In postscript, some time after his death, Elysius used his 
and her own genetic material to have his posthumous child, named Genis-Vell. 
Genis-Vell was artificially aged to prevent Mar-Vell's enemies from taking 
revenge on a helpless child, and Genis went on a quest to discover his heritage, 
assuming first the name Legacy, and then (with the consent of Monica Rambeau) 
Captain Marvel. </FONT></P>
