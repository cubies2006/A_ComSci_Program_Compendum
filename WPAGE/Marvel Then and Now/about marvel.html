      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">Marvel Enterprises Inc., one of 
      the world’s leading comic book, toy, and entertainment companies. It is 
      the holding company for Marvel Entertainment Group, the largest publisher 
      of comic books in the United States and the creator of many of the comic 
      book industry’s most popular characters, including Spider-Man, the X-Men, 
      the Fantastic Four, the Incredible Hulk, and Captain America. Marvel 
      characters have formed the subjects of many television programs, animated 
      cartoons, books, and video games.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">Marvel Enterprises also makes 
      action figures and other toys based on Marvel characters and owns Panini, 
      an Italian manufacturer of children’s stickers. Marvel Enterprises was 
      formed when Toy Biz, a toy maker, acquired Marvel Entertainment Group in 
      1998. The company is based in New York City.</font></p>

      <li><font color="#0aa0e0" size="4"><b>II. EARLY HISTORY</b></font>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">Marvel dates to 1932, when 
      magazine distributor Martin Goodman founded Western Fiction Publishing Co. 
      in New York City. Goodman later launched a separate comic book company, 
      Timely Publications. In 1939 Timely released the first issue of its 
      10-cent Marvel Comics, which featured two superheroes: the Human Torch, a 
      man who could turn his body into flame; and Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner, 
      an undersea superhero.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1941 Timely’s Joe Simon and 
      Jack Kirby created Captain America, a patriotic character whose sole 
      purpose was to battle the German Nazis. Timely’s superhero titles enjoyed 
      great popularity during the early 1940s, and by 1950 the company was 
      publishing 82 titles. A year later the company was renamed Atlas 
      Publishing. In the 1950s, with superhero comic books declining in 
      popularity, Atlas published mostly romance, Western, war, and horror 
      titles.</font></p>

      <li><font color="turquoise" size="4"><b>III. INNOVATIVE 
      CHARACTERS</b></font>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1961 Stan Lee, the company’s 
      editor, head writer, and art director, created a team of superheroes, the 
      Fantastic Four, to compete with the popular Justice League of America 
      created by rival DC Comics. Disliking the simplistic and stereotyped 
      characters of the time, Lee included sarcasm, antisocial superheroes, 
      character flaws, and even sympathetic villains in Fantastic Four. The 
      comic book was an enormous success, and readers responded to Lee’s 
      innovations with an outpouring of fan mail.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">Hoping to build on the success of 
      these unconventional characters, in 1962 Lee created The Incredible Hulk, 
      drawn by Jack Kirby. The comic book told the story of Dr. Bruce Banner, a 
      nuclear scientist who, after an accidental exposure to massive amounts of 
      gamma radiation, transforms into a raging, super-strong monster with green 
      skin—the Hulk (originally the Hulk had gray skin). Lee’s influences in 
      developing the character included English novelist Mary Shelley and 
      Scottish novelist Robert Louis Stevenson. Like Shelley’s Frankenstein, the 
      Hulk was a frightening yet misunderstood monster who did not seek to harm 
      people. Like Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, he involuntarily and 
      constantly changed between Banner and the Hulk. The character was a huge 
      hit, and Atlas’s sales soared.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">Only three months after the 
      Hulk’s debut, Lee unveiled the character that would become the symbol of 
      Marvel Comics and one of the most popular superheroes in history: 
      Spider-Man. Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962), illustrated by Steve Ditko, 
      told the story of Peter Parker, a socially awkward high-school teenager 
      who acquires superhuman strength, speed, and agility when he is bitten by 
      a radioactive spider. The comic book was one of the first to feature a 
      teenager as a superhero rather than as a sidekick. In addition, Lee gave 
      Peter Parker personal problems—with his love life, self-esteem, and 
      bullies—that many young male comics readers shared. The issue was a 
      bestseller, and Spider-Man soon was featured in his own comic book, The 
      Amazing Spider-Man.</font></p>

      <li><font color="pink" size="4"><b>IV. GROWTH AND 
      EXPANSION</b></font>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1963 Goodman renamed the 
      company Marvel Comics Group. Marvel’s ascendance, and that of the entire 
      industry, continued throughout the 1960s. The company introduced many new 
      characters, including Thor, God of Thunder, a superhero based on Norse 
      mythology (1962); the X-Men, a team of mutant superheroes (1963); 
      Daredevil, the first blind superhero (1964); Silver Surfer, an alien with 
      energy-based powers who flies on a silver surfboard (1966); and Black 
      Panther, the first black superhero (1966). Marvel characters soon found 
      their way onto television programs, T-shirts, board games, and lunch 
      boxes. By 1968 Marvel sold 50 million comic books a year. That year 
      Goodman sold the business to Cadence Industries Corporation.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">The 1970s brought another slump 
      in the comics industry. Marvel rebounded by licensing its characters to 
      other media. “The Incredible Hulk” television series ran from 1977 until 
      1982. In the 1980s Marvel’s sales surpassed those of DC for the first 
      time. In 1986 New World Entertainment, a motion-picture company, bought 
      Marvel. Two years later Marvel was acquired by MacAndrews &amp; Forbes 
      Holdings, controlled by financier Ronald O. Perelman.</font></p>

      <li><font color="yellow" size="4"><b>V. RECENT 
      DEVELOPMENTS</b></font>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">During the 1990s Marvel stepped 
      up its licensing, diversification, and globalization efforts. Marvel 
      purchased several companies, including trading-card companies Fleer 
      Corporation and Skybox International, and invested in toy company Toy Biz, 
      which was given licensing rights to make products based on Marvel 
      characters. Several animated television series were released about Marvel 
      characters, including Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, the X-Men, and 
      Silver Surfer. The X-Men emerged as Marvel’s most successful line of 
      comics in the 1990s.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">Marvel’s revenues more than 
      quadrupled from 1991 to 1994. Shortly thereafter, however, sales of comics 
      fell across the industry, and the 1994 professional baseball players’ 
      strike hurt Marvel’s trading-card business. In 1996 Marvel eliminated 
      unprofitable titles, laid off nearly one-third of its staff, and filed for 
      Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. A lengthy legal battle ensued over the 
      control of the company, and a federal judge ruled in 1997 that an 
      independent trustee should run the company.</font></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1998 Toy Biz and Marvel merged 
      into a single company under a Chapter 11 reorganization plan. The combined 
      company sold Fleer/Skybox International, its trading-card business, in 
      1999. That same year Sony Pictures Entertainment and Marvel agreed to 
      collaborate on the production of movies, television shows, and related 
      merchandise involving Marvel’s Spider-Man character.</font></p>
