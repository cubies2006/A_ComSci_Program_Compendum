<P align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><FONT face=Verdana>Biographical Description:</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>Real Name: En Dwi Gast<BR>Occupation: Galactic 
Gamesplayer<BR>Group Affiliation: Elders of the Universe<BR>First Appearance: 
Avengers #69</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana><BR>Physical Description:</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>Height: 7'1"<BR>Weight: 240 lbs.<BR>Eyes: Red, no visible 
pupils<BR>Hair: White<BR>Strength level: Unknown<BR>Known Superhuman Powers: As 
all elders, the Grandmaster is immune to aging and his body is virtually 
immortal.&nbsp; The Grandmaster has the ability to resurrect dead beings and 
restore to full life beings who are at the verge of death.&nbsp; He cannot, 
however, resurrect beings dead after a certain amount of time (hypothesized at 
29.5 hours). &nbsp; He cannot resurrect virtually immortal beings like himself 
either.&nbsp; The Grandmaster also has power over death and can will the death 
of another being, though it is not clear if he can do this to a being who is 
virtually immortal.&nbsp; He can also bestow these powers to another, but only 
for a few minutes.&nbsp; That being would have to use the powers within that 
time, or die himself.&nbsp; He also has a superhuman brain, which can solve 
problems in tenths of seconds and memorize millions of rules to various games 
throughout the universe.&nbsp; The Grandmaster can also sense information about 
his surrounding area.&nbsp; He also has the power to levitate himself, project 
energy blasts, teleport space, time, and dimensions, transform and rearrange 
matter, and has a psionic link to his computers on the unknown world he uses as 
a base.</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>History: Well, he basically has the same story as the rest 
of the Elders. The only left from his race, one of the first to appear after the 
Big Bang. Has survived only through concentration on one task to keep the mind 
busy, in En Dwi's case games of all sorts and kinds. He has learned and mastered 
most kinds of games in the known universe.&nbsp; Anyway, after he had mastered 
most of the games in the universe he got bored of that and turned to devising 
his own contests and tournaments. In these tournaments he involved champions or 
teams of champions and coerced them in some way to fight other champions or 
teams that had been picked by his opponent.</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>This happened for instance when En Dwi chose the Squadron 
Supreme of Counter-Earth to fight against the Scarlet Centurion's Institute of 
Evil. After En Dwi won that contest he decided that he should have a team of his 
own similar to the Squadron, since the originals did not want to participate in 
any further games. For that purpose he journeyed to Earth and took three 
earthmen and transformed them into the counterparts of Squadron members Whizzer, 
Dr. Spectrum and Nighthawk. In order to have a counterpart to Hyperion, the 
Grandmaster took some non-living extra-dimensional matter and put life, 
memories, consciousness and the pursuit of happiness (on second thought scratch 
the last one) into this slab of matter. And thus he named these counterparts the 
Squadron Sinister!! The Squadron got their first field test when pitted against 
the Avengers, when the Grandmaster fought with Kang himself, and of course they 
failed miserably. Thus, since old En Dwi has never been much of a humanitarian, 
he dropped the Squadron Sinister and decided to bet on the Invaders instead 
(those old WWII heroes), to fight the Avengers a second time. And what seemed to 
be a developing trend for En Dwi, he lost.</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>Later, the Grandmaster discovered that since Death had 
banned them from her kingdom, they should therefore live forever. But they got 
carried away with the idea and tried to kill Galactus. They collected all the 
soul gems, the ones Marvel later made the Infinity Gems and used them to try and 
kill Galactus, but the plan backfired and created a black hole that sucked the 
Trader, the Astronomer and the Possessor in. The Obliterator had been rendered 
powerless by the Silver Surfer before and then Galactus seemed to absorb the 
energies of the Grandmaster, as well as Gardener, the Runner, the Champion, and 
the Collector. But the Elders survived. The Grandmaster later fights Galactus in 
a game over one of the Infinity Gems, which he loses.</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>He was last seen getting involved with a game set between 
the Avengers and Ultraverse’s Ultra Force.</FONT></b></P>
