    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">The cover of the first issue 
    depicted the Human Torch melting his way through a steel door to confront a 
    crook armed with a pistol and a hand grenade. This fiery super hero, created 
    by Carl Burgos, joined Bill Everett's aquatic avenger The Sub-Mariner to 
    become one of the twin stars of the immediately successful Marvel Comics. 
    The debut of two major heroes in one comic book was especially appreciated 
    by depression-era kids looking for thrills and adventure at bargain prices.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory1.jpg" align="left" width="217" height="296"> </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">This first issue of Marvel Comics, 
    originally priced at ten cents, has become perhaps the most valuable comic 
    book ever published. In 1987 a rare copy in mint condition changed hands for 
    $82,000. Its status as the maiden effort of the Marvel line, coupled with 
    its atypical introduction of two classic characters, has made it a cherished 
    milestone of popular culture.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Published in October 1939 and 
    reprinted the following month, this comic book is the embodiment of what 
    fans call the Golden Age, that period of innocence when both fans and the 
    comics themselves were young. Because comic books were new, every page 
    promised something fresh and interesting. The exhilaration of a new medium 
    shines through, for this was a golden age for the comic book creators as 
    well.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory2.jpg" align="right" width="153" height="214"> </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Captain America was the hero who 
    put Marvel, then know as Timely, into the top rank of comic publishers. The 
    time was ripe for an idealized freedom fighter that possessed &quot;the character 
    to win and to triumph over evil.&quot; The cover of Captain America #1, which 
    showed the new hero, dressed in red, white and blue, punching Adolf Hitler 
    in the face. The date was March 1941, nine months before Pearl Harbor. The 
    timing was perfect, and the unusual move of starting a new character in his 
    own comic book would prove to be very successful.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Sales were up to, after the first 
    issue, close to the million mark. A circulation figure like that, far above 
    what most popular comics achieve today, put Captain America in the same 
    league with Superman and Batman as one of the true giants of the Golden Age. 
    As a contrast, consider that the weekly circulation of Time magazine during 
    the same time period was 700,000.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Captain America was not born with 
    great power, but rather had it bestowed upon him as a gift. The champion of 
    freedom started out as Steve Rogers, a scrawny 4-F rejected by the army and 
    then redeemed by a dose of a strange liquid that turned him into a hero. It 
    could happen to anyone, even the ordinary reader. And part of the attraction 
    was that Steve Rogers never became excessively gifted; he wasn't 
    invulnerable - he was just tougher and braver and smarter than anyone else.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory3.jpg" align="left" width="220" height="300"> </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">The Red Skull was the greatest 
    villain of the Golden Age. Created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby for the first 
    issue of Captain America, he was originally a Nazi spy who was killed, 
    unmasked and revealed to be a corrupt American industrialist named George 
    Maxon. Like many villains the Red Skull found death a temporary thing and 
    returned again and again. The details of his first appearance were forgotten 
    and he was transformed into an icon of Nazi cruelty.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">By the end of 1941 when the United 
    States actually entered the war, many of Timely's characters had already 
    been fighting it for so long that at first the change in the comics wasn't 
    easy to discern. Ironically, by the time the war really came the fighting 
    super heroes no longer had the comic book stage all to themselves. Beginning 
    in April 1942, Timely expanded into humor comics. Timely's move was a 
    response to the success of adaptations of Disney's animated cartoon 
    characters.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Then, almost accidentally, Timely 
    tapped into a new audience: teenage girls. The cause of it all was a female 
    character who made her debut in the back pages of Marvel Mystery Comics in 
    1943. Miss America, created by Otto Binder, was dressed in stars and stripes 
    and was clearly a female version of Captain America. She got her own title 
    in 1944 and very soon it turned Timely toward a new audience. Almost 
    immediately the title character was dropped and Miss America Comics began to 
    focus on the activities of average American female adolescents. Features 
    were added on clothes, makeup and cooking, and a whole new division of 
    comics came into being.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory4.jpg" align="right" width="148" height="213"> </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Stan Lee made several attempts to 
    boost up the sagging super heroes. The three old reliables, Captain America, 
    The Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner had been featured together on some of 
    Alex Schomburg's wartime covers, but the trio had never been in the same 
    story. Now, in 1946, Lee created The All Winners Squad for the nineteenth 
    issue of All Winners Comics. He put the big three into the same story along 
    with Miss America and the Whizzer. A few years earlier such a move might 
    have created a sensation, but now the public didn't seem to care. The book 
    length super-crossovers lasted two issues; then All Winners was cancelled.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory5.jpg" align="left" width="148" height="206"> </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">By 1949 there was no place for the 
    amazing if occasionally absurd super heroes who had defined the Golden Age. 
    The old heroes who had gone to war before the country did just faded away 
    while everyone was busy reading cowboys, crime and love stories. There was 
    even room in the 1949 publication schedule for a comic book called Blaze the 
    Wonder Collie. Gene Colan drew the cover of the final issue of Captain 
    America (February 1950), but by then it was a horror comic called Captain 
    America's Weird Tales and Captain America didn't even appear in it. The 
    Human Torch was cancelled in March 1949, and his former sparring partner The 
    Sub-Mariner sank three months later. Marvel Mystery Comics, the title that 
    had started it all, disappeared in June 1949. It had run for a very 
    successful ninety two issues.</font></p>
