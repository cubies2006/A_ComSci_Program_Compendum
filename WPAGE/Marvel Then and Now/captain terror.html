<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dan Kane seems to be an idle playboy, but he has a deep, dark secret. He used 
to be Captain Terror. Dan and his friend Bill are discussing the dire situation 
on the oceans following a Nazi U-boat attack, and Bill says, "We need a man like 
Captain Terror!!...it's too bad he was killed in Spain a few years ago--" Two 
panels later Dan Kane muses aloud, "After the Spanish war I preferred to have 
the people think I was dead." It's clear from context that he was involved, on 
the side of the good guys, in the Spanish Civil War, but nothing more is said 
about this, although in <I>USA</I> #2 he says how good it is to be in action 
again, so he's obviously been out of action for a while. In <I>Captain 
America</I> #442, set in the modern day, he appears as an aging but still 
willing hero. </font> 
<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Captain Terror has no superpowers, but he's got his own boat and fighter, and 
he's a good pilot, sailor, and is (of course) good with his fists. </font> 
<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><B>Note</B>: Roger Stern originally had plans for Captain Terror in the late 
and much-lamented <I>Marvel Universe</I>, but alas, those never came to pass. <BR>
