<img border="0" src="ultimo.gif" align="left" width="518" height="587">Ultimo was once the bane of many space faring peoples. He was 
referred to as the Devastator or “He-Who-Destroys”. A group from the planet 
Rajak that Ultimo had destroyed came seeking vengeance, but Ultimo was too 
powerful for them. They were forced to flee and led Ultimo into a meteor cluster 
near the planet Earth. The meteors knocked both Ultimo and those from Rajak to 
Earth. Ultimo landed in China where he laid inert until he was discovered by the 
Mandarin.</font></P>
