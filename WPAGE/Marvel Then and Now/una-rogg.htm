<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="una-rogg.gif" align="left" width="356" height="700">Una-Rogg is the daughter of the traitorous Yon-Rogg, and sister to 
the vengeful Zey-Rogg. Una-Rogg as a Kree women has the inherant ability to bend 
Kree men's wills. All women have the ability, but in order to keep the female of 
the race under their thumbs the men of the Kree have a sort of mental 
circumcision that cuts them off from this ability. This operation sadly has a 
side effect cutting the women off from their pleasure centers.</font></P>
<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A tiny percentage of Kree females also develop the ability to drain men of 
their life force simply by kissing them. Because of this ability all women are 
subjected to the mutilation. Yon-Rogg saved his daughter and falsified the 
documents. Coincidentally, Una-Rogg is one of the rare females who develop the 
life force draining ability.</font></P>
