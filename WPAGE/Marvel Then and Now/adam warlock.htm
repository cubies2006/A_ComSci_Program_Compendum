<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>History: HIM was birthed at an Earthen scientific complex 
called The Bee Hive. The goal of his creators was to birth the perfect human. 
But it was a dream beyond their scope, if not their abilities. While in the 
cacoon Adam Warlock learned of the evil schemes his creators had. Realization 
soon dawned on the creators that they had created something beyond their 
control. And so Adam Warlock came into this reality. A being without parentage. 
A creature who would reach maturity without supervision and uncontrolled. After 
abandoning his homeworld (Earth), Warlock's next encounter with sentient life 
was with the Asgardian, Thor. In this meeting, Warlock attempted the physical 
abduction of the goddess Sif in order to force her to become his mate. Adam 
Warlock then battled Thor, and got himself killed in the process.&nbsp;
