<P>Like any other powerful and well known mythical being, Thor has appeared in 
comics many times, and been handled many different ways. But when we think of 
him in this context, only one version really stands out — the one that has been 
a mainstay of <A href="http://www.toonopedia.com/marvel.htm">Marvel Comics</A> 
since the early 1960s. 
<P><I>Journey into Mystery,</I> like all of Marvel's then-extant sci-fi/monster 
comics, was made over into a <A 
href="http://www.toonopedia.com/glossary.htm#superhero">superhero</A> book when 
that genre made its comeback. The 83rd issue (August, 1962) told the story of 
frail, lame Dr. Donald Blake, who found an ancient walking stick with an 
inscription. It claimed that the stick could be transformed into the hammer of 
Thor, imbuing its wielder with all the power of the legendary Teutonic thunder 
god. This was a handy thing to have, because right at the moment, Blake happened 
to need a lot of power to foil an interplanetary invasion. The deed done, he 
changed the hammer back into a walking stick, and himself back into the 
mild-mannered medical man. 
<P>Like the majority of Marvel's superheroes of the 1962-63 vintage, Thor was 
initially written by Stan Lee and drawn by Jack Kirby. Also, like most, Kirby 
stayed only a few issues. Joe Sinnott drew most of the Thor stories during the 
first year or two, but there was also an occasional fill-in artist. One issue, 
in fact, was drawn by Al Hartley, better known for his work on <A 
href="http://www.toonopedia.com/millie.htm">Millie the Model</A> and <A 
href="http://www.toonopedia.com/archie.htm">Archie</A> than anything having to 
do with superheroes. 
<P>Unlike most of the series Kirby kicked off during that period, Thor drew him 
back. He returned to do dozens more stories, throughout the 1960s. 
<P>More characters from the Norse pantheon turned up, starting in the third 
issue, when Loki, Thor's evil half-brother, became the series' first recurring 
villain. Before long, the thunder god was making regular trips to Asgard, where 
he would interact with such personages as Heimdal, Baldur, Sif, and even Odin 
himself. It became hard to reconcile the lame doctor with Thor's eons-old 
relationships with his fellow deities, so a <A 
href="http://www.toonopedia.com/glossary.htm#retcon">retcon</A> was concocted by 
way of explanation: Blake had been Thor all along, sentenced by Odin to inhabit 
a less magnificent body, his memory erased, until he got over his rather 
insufferable pride. The walking stick had been planted as a way of easing him 
back into the fold. Eventually, the Blake persona was completely written out of 
the series. 
<P>Thor's sojourn on Midgard (as Earth is called in this mythological context) 
brought him many lasting friendships. Among the most significant were his fellow 
members of <A href="http://www.toonopedia.com/avengers.htm">The Avengers,</A> a 
group that was formed when other Marvel characters — <A 
href="http://www.toonopedia.com/antman.htm">Ant Man,</A> <A 
href="http://www.toonopedia.com/wasp.htm">The Wasp,</A> <A 
href="http://www.toonopedia.com/ironman.htm">Iron Man</A> and <A 
href="http://www.toonopedia.com/hulk.htm">The Hulk</A> — became involved in one 
of Loki's schemes. Thor has maintained active participation in the group fairly 
steadily over the years, and even now, frequently appears as part of it. 
<P>In the beginning, the sci-fi/monster stories continued to appear in the back 
pages of <I>Journey into Mystery.</I> That ended in #97 (October, 1963), when 
"Tales of Asgard" took over that spot. With #104 (May, 1964), Thor's name began 
appearing more prominently than that of the magazine's actual title. When, in 
1966, the original title disappeared altogether, and its official name became 
<I>The Mighty Thor,</I> the event was scarcely even noticed. 
<P>As steady a seller as he's been in comics, Marvel's version of Thor has 
scarcely set foot into other story media. He was one of the stars of the 
half-hour Marvel Super Heroes animated series, along with <A 
href="http://www.toonopedia.com/capamer.htm">Captain America</A> and <A 
href="http://www.toonopedia.com/subbie.htm">The Sub-Mariner,</A> which was 
syndicated from 1966-68 — but considering the esteem in which those cartoons are 
held, that's no great honor. He appeared in one or two paperback novelizations 
of The Avengers. And something vaguely recognizable as the old Blake/Thor 
relationship was seen in one of the post-series <I>Incredible Hulk</I> TV 
movies. But that's about it. 
<P>But in the comic books where he was born, he has been a prominent part of the 
Marvel <A href="http://www.toonopedia.com/glossary.htm#universe">Universe</A> 
since its very early days — and retains that position even now.
