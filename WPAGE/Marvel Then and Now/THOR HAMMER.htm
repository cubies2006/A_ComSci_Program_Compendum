of Thor </FONT></FONT></CENTER></FONT>
<P><I>"Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power 
of... THOR"</I> 
<P><BR>
<DD>Thor's principal weapon is the enchanted hammer named Mjolnir, one of the 
most formidable weapons known to man or god. Forged out of the mystical metal 
uru, whose chief properties are durability and ability to maintain enchantment, 
the hammer is two feet long and its handle is wrapped in leather which 
terminates in a thong. Besides being a nearly indestructible throwing weapon, 
the hammer has been given six enchantments by Odin to augment its physical 
qualities. 
<P></P>
<DD><B>The first enchantment</B> is that no living being can lift the hammer 
from the ground unless he or she is worthy. Hence, so far as is known, only 
Odin, Thor, and Beta Ray Bill are able to lift Mjolnir. Apparently no one 
without superhuman strength can lift the hammer, whether he or she is worthy or 
not. 
<P></P>
<DD><B>The second enchantment</B> causes the hammer to return to the exact spot 
from which it is thrown after striking its target. 
<P></P>
<DD><B>The third enchantment</B> enables the hammer's wielder to summon the 
elements of storm (wind, rain, thunder, lightning, and so forth) by stamping its 
handle twice upon the ground and willing it to do so. Thor can also project 
various forms of mystical energy from the hammer without striking it on the 
ground. 
<P></P>
<DD><B.THE b enchantment< fourth>enables the hammer to open interdimensional 
portals, allowing its wielder to travel to other dimensions, such as Earth to 
Asgard. (It is not known how Thor locates the dimension to which he wishes to 
travel.) 
<P></P>
<DD><B>The fifth enchantment</B>, bestowed on the hammer by Odin in recent 
times, enabled Thor to transform into the mortal Don Blake, by stamping the 
hammer once upon the ground and willing the change to occur. When Thor became 
Blake, Mjolnir became a gnarled wooden cane. By stamping the cane upon the 
ground and willing the change to occur, Blake could turn himself back to his 
godly form of Thor, and the cane would again become the hammer. When the hammer 
was in the form of a cane, anyone could lift it. A provision of the enchantment 
required that the hammer could not be out of Thor's hand for over 60 seconds 
while he was on Earth without his spontaneous reversion to his mortal self. 
<BR>Most of the fifth enchantment has been transferred to the hammer of Beta Ray 
Bill. However, enough of the fifth enchantment remains in Thor's hammer so that 
by stamping his hammer, he can instantaneously transform his Thor costume into 
Sigurd Jarlson's clothing, or vice versa. The hammer itself does not change 
form. 
<P></P>
<DD><B>The hammer has had one enchantment that has been rescinded.</B> Formerly 
the hammer could be swung in such a way as to generate chronal displacement 
inertia, enabling its wielder to travel through time. Most of this property, 
which is separate from the hammer's power to traverse dimensions, was removed by 
Immortus, and Thor himself recently apparently exhausted whatever time-traveling 
power Mjolnir had remaining. 
<P></P>
<DD>By throwing the hammer and grasping its leather thong, Thor can magically 
propel himself through the air in the semblance of flight. Just as the hammer 
can magically change its course in order to return to his hand when he throws 
it, so can it be influenced by its wielder to change its course while it is in 
his grasp in flight. The precise manner in which Thor "steers" his hammer while 
in flight is not known, nor is the precise speed and distance Thor can attain 
with a single throw. Thor has been observed to be able to attain escape velocity 
from Earth's gravity with a single throw and to overtake space vessels.
