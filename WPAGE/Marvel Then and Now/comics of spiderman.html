src="DAREDEVIL ELECTRO_files/asm9.jpg" width=172 align=right>-Max Dillon puts on his Electro costume. He then charges himself up with 
power just in case, and then heads out. Electro walks up to an armored car. He 
tells the guards not to bother putting the gold they have in the truck. They see 
Electro’s costume, and figure him for a crackpot. Electro zaps the gun and the 
bag of gold out of their hands. Electro then surrounds all the guards with a 
ring of electricity until they give him the bags. The next day at the Forest 
Hills bank the guard notices a flash of lightning. He goes to ring the alarm, 
but as he touches it Electro blasts him knocking out both the guard and the 
alarm. Electro walks in as J Jonah Jameson is trying to get some figures. JJ 
says that Electro can’t do this so Electro stuns them electrifying their tie 
pins and belt buckles. Electro uses his power to open the time locked vault. JJ 
figures that since Electro recognized him that it must be someone he knows. 
Minutes later Electro makes off with a bag of cash. Electro scales the outside 
of the building using his electric power on the iron beams to act like magnets. 
JJ figures the swagger and the climbing means that Spider-Man is Electro. JJ 
prints it in the paper, and everyone figures it must be true if it’s in print. 
Aunt May needs an operation. Peter asks JJ for one thousand dollars. JJ refuses, 
but offers Peter the money for a photo that proves Spider-Man is Electro. Peter 
takes off to capture Electro and collect the reward on him. Spider-Man finds 
Electro using his power like a mine detector. He finds a hidden safe and steals 
the contents. Electro spots Spider-Man and tries to blast him. He says he has 
wanted to prove his power was greater than Spider-Man's. Spidey webs Electro’s 
face and then goes down to grab him. Electro burns the webbing off his face, and 
then blasts Spidey as Spidey puts his hand on him. Electro leaves. Peter gives 
Jameson “proof” of Electro being Spider-Man to get the money. Electro laughs as 
he reads the paper since he thinks Spider-Man dead, and unable to clear his 
name. Electro breaks a bunch of prisoners about to be sent to the federal pen. 
Electro frees them to be his goons. The police surround the building, and 
Electro tries to assert control over the inmates. Spider-Man puts on rubber 
boots and gloves. Spider-Man keeps throwing metal objects past Electro to divert 
his power towards them. Spider-Man punches Electro. Electro releases a powerful 
electrical blast to revitalize himself. Spider-Man trips Electro with some 
bearings. Electro hides while his goons run from Spider-Man. Electro tries 
blasting Spider-Man both with his power and a gun. Spider-Man kicks sand at 
Electro. Electro turns the sand to glass, but it gives Spidey time to web 
Electro’s gun. Electro picks up some power wires and starts whipping them 
around. Spider-Man bumps into a firehouse. Spider-Man sprays Electro and 
short-circuits him. Spidey unmasks Electro, but has no idea who he 
is.</FONT></b></p>

align=right>Max Dillon is working for a carnival as the 
“Amazing Electro”. They strap him into an electric chair and flip the switch. 
Bolts run through his body. Electro’s favorite part is when he suddenly opens 
his eyes after they’re done shocking him. The crowd cheers and Max feels good 
about himself. Max tells the barker that he is gonna go get some grub. The 
barker says that he has one more trick to do first. Max says that he said he 
didn’t want to do that trick anymore. The barker says that he either does the 
trick or he is fired. The barker sticks a light bulb in Electro’s mouth and it 
lights up. Everyone starts to laugh at Electro. Electro gets mad and the light 
bulb bursts in his mouth. Later Max is walking down the street. He sees a storm 
coming up and thinks about how much he loves lightning and thunder. He remembers 
that when he was a kid he used to like to sneak out and run around in the rain 
during thunderstorms. Max recalls how his overprotective mother would call him 
in and make him take his temperature. Max supposes that she was just so 
overprotective because his father died (or as revealed later abandoned them), 
and he was all she had left. Electro walks into a store and tries to buy a 
bottle of something, but the clerk and the woman she is talking to don’t even 
interrupt their conversation to help him. Max walks out thinking that whole his 
whole life has been this way. He says that even when his mother let him play 
with other children they never liked him, or even picked on him, they just 
ignored him. Max shouts that he isn’t a nobody as a bolt of lightning strikes 
him from the sky. Max thinks how nothing changed for him after his mother’s 
death except that he got a wonderful job working with electric lines. Max thinks 
how he used to dream of tapping the power, and how the freak accident that 
should have killed him instead made him reborn. Electro shouts that he isn’t Max 
Dillon, that he is Electro. Max thinks how when he would walk into a bank 
dressed as Electro that everyone would take notice of him. He says that it is no 
wonder he feels so small again always being defeated by Spider-Man and put in 
jail. Suddenly Electro gets an idea. Some time later Electro gets off a bus in 
New York City. A panhandler asks Electro for some change. He looks up at The Top 
of New York hotel and thinks how it is his destiny. The panhandler is still 
harassing Max so Max shoots a bolt of electricity at him though not meaning to. 
Later in a hotel room Max gets into his Electro gear thinking how if he pulls 
this off everybody will remember him. He blasts The Top of New York’s roof, and 
says that he is gonna light the night.</FONT></b></p>
