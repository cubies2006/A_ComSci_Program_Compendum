      <P class=normal>Group affiliation: Defenders
      <P>Norman Radd was once a member of a long lived alien race, that had 
      evolved out of the reaches of disease, famine and war. The planet 
      Zenn-La's utopia was shattered when Galactus threatened to devour all that 
      they held sacred. Radd volunteered as peacemaker, only to keep the peace 
      on his home planet, he'd have to serve Galactus in finding other worlds 
      for the powermonger to destroy.
      <P>After receiving his new atomically reconstruted body and transport, he 
      quickly grew weary of condeming worlds to Galactus, and his visit to Earth 
      heralded his betrayal- and being Earthbound became his punishment.
      <P>Whilst on Earth he joined the Defenders and stood proudly alongside the 
      likes of the <A href="http://www.cocs.com/hulk.asp">Hulk</A> and the 
      Sub-Mariner, and with the help of the <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/fantasticfour.asp">Fantastic Four</A>, his exile 
      was finally broken allowing him to once again surf the wave of infinite 
      space.
