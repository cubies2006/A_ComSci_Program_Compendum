didn't remember doing it. Hank managed to create an artificial intelligence: 
Ultron-1. Ultron-1 then shot Hank with a hypnotic ray causing him to forget his 
newest invention. Ultron managed to escape and upgrade himself until finally he 
confronted the Avengers as Ultron-5. Ultron was also responsible for creating 
the Vision, who possesses the brain patterns of Simon Williams, Wonder Man, thus 
creating a very dysfunctional family out of Earth's Mightiest Heroes. </font> </P>
