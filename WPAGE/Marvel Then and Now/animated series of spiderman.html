    all means to support herself and Peter. Hoping to make money, Peter decides 
    to return to the entertainment business. When he goes to see Maxie Schiffman, 
    Maxie wouldn't represent him anymore because the Bugle

    Spidey and the Human Torch, Johnny Storm, two heroes who would distrust each 
    other at first (because they were so alike), but they would become the best 
    of friends later on. From there, Spidey would fight the Chameleon (Dmitri 
    Smerdyakov), the Vulture (Adrian Toomes) and the Tinkerer (with actors in 
    alien costumes - one of them being Quentin Beck, later known Mysterio) and 
    he'd defeat them by using his mind and strength.</a></font></b></p>

    fighting super-villains and selling them to newspapers, such as the Daily 
    Bugle. Peter heads off to the Bugle, there he meets for the first time its 
    editor, the hard headed anti-vigilante J. 
    Jonah Jameson. Peter agreed to sell the photos to JJJ if he didn't have his 
    name printed on the paper and that JJJ would never ask how he manages to get 
    such great pictures of the hero. But before his super-hero career could kick 
    into high gear, it would appear that it would end very quickly.</font></b></p>

    High. Peter goes and it seems to him that Johnny Storm is directly talking

    Ock. This time he defeats the man with 6 arms. From there Spidey would fight 
    a bunch of new super-villains like Doctor Doom (Victor Von Doom), Mysterio

    that battle Spidey met the threat of Mendel Stromm the Robot Master. Stromm 
    had just been released from jail and wanted to get back at his former 
    employer and friend Norman Osborn, but Spidey saved the day and Stromm ended 
    up by dying. Spidey saved the day, but he was getting ready for the biggest 
    threat to his civilian identity he has seen.</font></b></p>

    Goblin develops a gas which negates Spider-Man's spider sense. With that, 
    the Goblin discovers Spider-Man's true civilian identity. He was humuliated 
    that he had lost many times to a mere teenager, but he was shocked at his 
    true identity. He captures the hero and he takes him to his hideout where 
    the Goblin takes off his mask and reveals his own ID to Peter. The Goblin 
    was the father of one of his closest friends, Norman Osborn !! The Goblin 
    tells his origin; Norman had his partner Stromm arrested, and while looking 
    through Stromm's stuff, Norman found a formula that would give him great 
    strength and intelligence. He took the<img src="MacroSpidey80g.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="150" height="170"> 
    formula and became the Green Goblin ! After that. the two fought until an 
    explosion caused Norman to turn into an amnesiac. He would forget that he 
    ever was the Green Goblin, and that Peter is Spider-Man, thus eliminating 
    the last few years of his life from his brain. Spidey burnt Norman's GG 
    costume so the public would never find out his sceret and so Norman and 
    Harry can live a normal life together. This would be the last we'd see of 
    the Goblin for the meantime.<br>
    Peter finally meets Mary Jane for the first time and falls for the beauty of 
    this party girl. But instead of falling for MJ, he would pursue Gwen Stacy. 
    Peter and Gwen would go out for a long time. MJ would want to go out with 
    Peter, but instead settles for Harry (a relationship which wouldn't last). 
    Flash would be forced to go to Vietnam to fight in the war. During the 
    Peter-Gwen relationship, Spidey was having his own problems.</font></b></a></p>

    betrayed U.S. secrets and were killed in a plane crash over Europe. Peter 
    confronts May about this, and May tells Peter that she never showed showed

    meets for the first time Joseph 'Robbie' Robertson (the new publisher of the 
    Daily Bugle) and Captain George Stacy of the police force, who will become 
    valuable allies in the future. During a fight between Spidey and Doc Ock, 
    Ock manages to knock a wall down. That wall is going to fall on a helpless

    that life, George gets crushed by the rubble. Spider-Man goes to his side 
    and George says his final words to the hero &quot;Peter, always look after Gwen&quot; 
    which means that George always knew about Peter's dual identity. With the 
    propaganda running in the Daily Bugle claiming that Spider-Man killed the 
    respected police captain, Gwen believed it and hated Spider-Man. Not only 
    that, but Peter, who was trying to defend the Wall-Crawler, was dumped by

    closely on the single Peter. At the play, Norman thought something was
