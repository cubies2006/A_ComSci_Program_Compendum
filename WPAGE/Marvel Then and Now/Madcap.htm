align=left>Madcap was a god fearing man when he was involved in a horrible truck 
accident that involved some highly toxic materials from AIM. The accident killed 
his entire family and left him completely impervious to pain. The accident had 
another effect in that it destroyed Madcap's mind. Madcap's mission is to point 
out to everyone that life has no point.</P>
<P><FONT size=2>Captain America #309- flashback- Madcap, in his human life, is 
seen on his knees praying to God in church. One day his church group, along with 
his parents and baby sister, was on a field trip to Bear Mountain when a truck 
hits their bus going 100 miles per hour. The truck explodes and the chemical 
that it was carrying leaks out. The chemical was a compound designed by AIM. AIM 
troops surround him, but decide that there were no survivors. Later in the 
hospital the man who becomes Madcap is found to have no injuries at all from the 
accident. He asks about the others, and when he finds out that he is the only 
survivor his mind snaps. The doctors want to keep him under observation, but 
Madcap leaves. He leaps in front of a car to commit suicide, but of course he 
isn’t hurt at all. Madcap asks why he benefited from an accident that killed 
everyone he cared about. A few days later, outside a costume shop, the answer 
occurs to him…no reason at all. Madcap decides to spread the word of the chaos 
and meaningless of life.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Captain America #307- In midtown Manhattan an 
ordinary looking man walks into a costume shop. The shopkeeper asks if he can 
help him. The man replies that he is beyond help, and that in fact everyone is. 
The man shoots the shopkeeper with a gun that surrounds the man in oddly colored 
bubbles. The shopkeeper starts to dance around like a chicken and making “bock 
bock” noises. The shopkeeper runs out of the store still acting like a chicken. 
Later, now dressed in costume, Madcap hangs from a streetlight shooting his 
bubble gun and driving everyone mad. Traffic has completely stopped and people 
are dancing around and playing tag. Madcap says that this won’t do, as some 
people are still not enjoying the chaos. A cop tells Madcap to freeze. Madcap 
draws first and sprays the cop with bubbles. The cop starts going crazy, but 
shoots Madcap in the chest. The wound immediately heals and Madcap hops up to 
create more chaos. Jack Monroe has a new job as a bagboy in a supermarket. 
Suddenly a large rock comes crashing through the storefront window. Outside 
everyone is going nuts. Jack changes into Nomad and runs out. Nomad spots Madcap 
shooting his bubble gun. Madcap says that life is one big joke, and that nothing 
is worth taking seriously. Nomad tackles Madcap off a car, but when they land he 
hears Madcap’s back break. Nomad comes in close to check on him, but Madcap just 
pokes Nomad in the eye and hops away. Nomad listens to Madcap’s ramblings and 
manages to hit him with a stun-disc. Madcap is driven into a wall and falls in 
an unnatural position. Nomad is worried he hurt Madcap, but Madcap snaps himself 
back together. Madcap introduces himself and so Nomad did too. Madcap tells 
Nomad a secret. He tells him that he can’t be hurt and has no sensation though 
he invites Nomad to continue trying. Nomad hits Madcap and manages to dislocate 
his jaw. Madcap compliments him but snaps his jaw back into place. Madcap kicks 
Nomad in the gut, and then finds where his bubble gun went. Madcap blasts Nomad 
with bubbles and hops away again. Madcap zaps another guy and then kicks over a 
trashcan. Madcap looks at his watch and decides 3:58 is a good time to quit. He 
leaps down the subway entrance. Jack Monroe loses his job and takes the subway 
home. He broods the entire ride home, but near him on the train Madcap is 
scrunched up giggling to himself.</FONT></P>

size=2>- In Coney Island, Madcap skips along singing his views of sanity and its 
irrelevance when a group of thugs confronts him. They say that they don’t take 
kindly to “fops” prancin' around their turf. The first one hits Madcap with a 
blackjack. Madcap laughs and so they hit him again. When Madcap keeps laughing 
another thug takes a knife and sticks it into Madcap’s chest. Madcap just keeps 
standing there. The thugs ask why he isn’t falling over. Madcap says that he 
comes with a warranty, “takes a stabbing and keeps on gabbing”. Madcap pulls the 
knife out and throws it into the arm of the guy who stuck it in him, y’know to 
give it back. Madcap zaps the rest of them with his bubble gun, and he takes his 
leave with the thugs jumping around crazily. Madcap makes it back to his home, 
but when gets inside someone is waiting for him. The someone is Nomad. Nomad is 
sitting in a chair and reminds Madcap of when they fought. Madcap starts taking 
off his costume. He says that he doesn’t get many visitors, less than none 
actually, and he asks why Nomad is there. Nomad says “no reason at all”. Madcap 
laughs and says that he likes that answer. Madcap gives Nomad a soda. Nomad says 
that he was thinking about what Madcap said about life not meaning anything and 
he decided that he agreed. Madcap is pleased that his message got through. Nomad 
asks about the newspaper clipping on his wall about the 42 people in the bus 
accident being killed. Madcap sews the knife hole in his costume up and tells 
Nomad the story of his origin. Nomad asks where Madcap got his “fun gun”. Madcap 
says that he got it at Woolworth’s for $1.49. Madcap excuses himself, but he 
needs to sleep. He offers Nomad the chair. Nomad says that he is the trusting 
sort, and Madcap says that he isn’t afraid Nomad is going to kill him or 
anything. The next morning Madcap wakes up. Nomad says that he sees Madcap is a 
late sleeper. Madcap says not really- he just wakes up when he wants to. Nomad 
asks what they are doing today. Madcap asks if Nomad is going to be his sidekick 
now. Nomad says that he wants to be inspired by Madcap’s lifestyle so he can go 
live a random life himself. Madcap throws some clothes to Nomad and tells him to 
put them on. Nomad asks why, but Madcap asks “why not?” They go out and eat at a 
restaurant and bolt on the check. Nomad thinks to himself that he will settle up 
later. Madcap says that Nomad is still a stiff, but he likes having him around. 
Madcap and Nomad get dressed for fun. As Madcap starts spreading his bubbles 
Nomad is trying to make sure people don’t get hurt. Nomad tackles Madcap and 
says that he did it for no reason. He takes the fun-gun, and tries to affect 
Madcap but the bubbles do nothing. Nomad runs with the gun so Madcap chases him. 
Nomad climbs to the top of the roller coaster. He crushes the gun. Madcap says 
that it cost his a dollar and forty nine cents. Nomad tries to convince Madcap 
to give up since his gun is broken. Madcap reveals that the gun was just a prop 
that the power comes from his eyes. Nomad wraps Madcap’s head up in his cape. 
Madcap kicks him off the coaster. Nomad swings back up, and before Madcap can 
get the cape off his head Nomad ties his hands with Madcap’s cape. Nomad carries 
him down.</FONT></P>

width=258 align=left></FONT><FONT size=2>Daredevil #234- Madcap is bounding 
along when he comes upon some smugglers. They see Madcap’s costume and figure he 
is a superhero. Madcap starts to fight the guys. Madcap dodges two of the guy’s 
bullets causing them to shoot one of their friends. One of the guys follows up 
by shooting Madcap in the chest, but Madcap just slams their heads together. Two 
guys grab him and throw him to the ground. As they shoot him Madcap glares at 
them and causes them to go insane. One still manages to shoot him in the 
forehead, but Madcap doesn’t seem to mind. The two guys start jumping around and 
acting like monkeys. He hypnotizes two more thugs and then leaves. As he walks 
away madcap runs into Dollar Bill. Dollar Bill is holding a camera and asks if 
Madcap knows where the gunfire was coming from. Madcap points out the four 
lunatics smashing crates. Bill guesses that Madcap is a superhero and tells him 
that he is going to make him a star. Daredevil overhears that Madcap escaped 
from Bellevue last night. The Rose puts out a $5000 bounty on Madcap. Later 
Madcap is starring on the Dollar Bill Show. Madcap grabs a knife and sticks it 
into his stomach. Madcap pulls it out and isn’t even hurt at all. Dollar Bill 
asks why he is called Madcap, and Madcap drives Dollar insane with his stare. 
Later Bill is filming Madcap walking down the street and Madcap asks Dollar how 
he is doing. Dollar tells Madcap to pretend he isn’t there so Madcap starts to 
ask people if they’ve seen Dollar Bill. A guy calls in a tip on Madcap’s 
location. A cab runs Madcap down, but Madcap pops right up. A bunch of mob guys 
show up and pull Madcap into a warehouse. Daredevil finds them there as a mob 
muscle is chopping into Madcap with an axe. Daredevil knocks out “Max the Axe”, 
but then the mob sets fire to the warehouse hoping to kill Daredevil and Madcap. 
Madcap convinces Daredevil to save Max instead of him. Madcap sits in the 
burning building singing for five hours until he is taken to the morgue. Dollar 
Bill is mourning Madcap when Madcap shows up with barely any costume left as it 
was burned away. Madcap starts dancing for the camera and says that they should 
call the show “Madcap’s Mystery Hour” instead of the Dollar Bill 
Show.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Power Pack #34- Katie Powers and Franklin 
Richards are both bored and nobody will play with them. Franklin goes to sleep 
and his dream self visits Katie Powers. Katie is watching television and asks 
Franklin if he wants to watch too. They’re watching the Madcap Mystery Hour. 
They watch Madcap drive five guys crazy. As they dance around Madcap gives the 
address to his studio. They decide that it might be fun to play with him. 
Franklin zaps ahead and starts talking to Madcap. Madcap agrees to go on an 
adventure with Franklin and Katie so Frank goes to tell Katie. While Franklin is 
gone Madcap spends the time cutting his fingers off and putting them back on. 
Franklin comes back and has Madcap open a window. Katie flies through the window 
with Franklin’s real body. Franklin wakes up. Madcap kisses Katie’s hand and 
they head out. Madcap sticks his head into the back of a compacting trash truck. 
Franklin and Katie get the trashmen to let him out. Madcap’s head is flat, but 
it reforms. Madcap grabs some sharp sticks to be pirates. The kids try to warn 
him, but Madcap still impales his head on the stick. Madcap finds his poked out 
eye and puts it back in. Madcap starts making people go insane and the kids are 
forced to help people from hurting themselves. They decide this isn’t so fun and 
go to Madcap to make him stop. Madcap is running into a bank that the police 
have some robbers surrounded in. The kids “protect” Madcap and distract the 
robbers long enough for the police to arrest them. They tell Madcap to behave 
more responsibly, but Madcap wanders off babbling to himself.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Sensational She-Hulk #9- (there is more Madcap in the issue than 
described here, but I find the fourth wall humor unfunny- so you’ll need to get 
the issue for that)- In an attempt to prove himself funnier than She-Hulk Madcap 
stands on top of a building in Central Park. He addresses the gathering crowd 
through a megaphone. Madcap dives off the building and lands directly on his 
head. Madcap springs up and gives the crowd his hypnotic stare. The crowd goes 
nuts and start running around. Madcap says that there is a little insanity in 
everyone, and that they are better off insane. She-Hulk sees a few of the 
children standing on top of the building getting ready to leap off the thing the 
way Madcap did. She goes to stop them. Madcap realizes that She-Hulk is going to 
be a spoilsport so he decides that he has to do something about that. Madcap 
leaps onto She-Hulk and tells her to kiss him. She-Hulk stares into Madcap’s 
eyes and causes her to go insane as well. She-Hulk still catches the kids, but 
she decides to start juggling them. Madcap loves it. She-Hulk realizes that 
Madcap is messing with her perceptions. She-Hulk says that Madcap’s exploits are 
pointless, and Madcap says that those are his feelings exactly. Madcap says that 
it is all how you look at things, and how they look at you. Madcap zaps She-Hulk 
with his bubble gun. She-Hulk turns to see a whale charging her. She grabs it 
and starts swinging it around. She-Hulk regains her senses and realizes that the 
whale she is holding isn’t alive. She-Hulk grabs Madcap, but makes the mistake 
of looking into Madcap’s eyes again. She-Hulk dumps out a trashcan and starts 
eating. Madcap is thrilled, but the crowd that is no longer insane is also no 
longer amused. Madcap tries to entertain them by sticking a knife through his 
head, but they don’t care. She-Hulk grabs Madcap and leaps to a location where 
nobody is. She-Hulk beats the stuffing out of Madcap, but of course he is fine 
seconds later. She-Hulk says that she won’t fight him anymore. She-Hulk rips his 
drawing out of the comic book at starts it on fire, but we’ll pretend he was 
sent to the Vault instead.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Avengers Spotlight #29-flashback- Madcap is taping an episode of 
Madcap Comedy Hour. He is standing in a barrel fire. He leaps out and changes 
into a non-burning costume. Madcap states his philosophy that there is no point 
to anything as a van drives up. Too goons get out and Madcap decides that maybe 
there is a point…on one of the guy's head. The goons tell Madcap that he is 
coming with them. As Madcap turns to play to the camera one of the guys' hands 
turns into a hammer and the other's into a vice. The vice guy grabs Madcap, and 
the hammer guy smashes the camera.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>Avengers Spotlight #29- Hawkeye, who had been contacted by 
Madcap's friend Dollar Bill, traces the van's license plates from the video to a 
bar called Scuzz. When the bartender pulls the "Bud" tap the bar flips over 
(guess they don't get a lot of requests for Bud on tap) and Hawkeye finds 
himself in a dark room where Madcap is hanging upside down. Dr. Karl Malus, who 
wanted Daredevil captured, tells his goons to kill Hawkeye. Hawkeye frees Madcap 
by cutting his ropes with arrows. As Madcap lands his arm is cut off by Handsaw. 
Madcap tries to give her his insanity stare, but her glasses block the effect. 
Malus wanted to study Daredevil's athletic prowess and Madcap's invulnerability, 
but with that wrecked he sets the self-destruct. Madcap pulls Handsaw's glasses 
off and makes Handsaw leap at her teammates. Madcap and Hawkeye runs out, but 
Madcap realizes he forgot to get his right arm back. He runs in as the building 
explodes. He puts the arm back on, and tells Hawkeye he is going to look for 
Malus. Malus' machine made him feel, and he wanted to feel more.</FONT></P>

brough the Impossible Woman and dozens of Impossible Children to Earth for a 
vacation. Impossible Woman and one kid meet up with Quasar. She tells him that 
the other children follow their ways, but that their daughter there refuses to 
have fun and shapeshift. Quasar tells her to find a shrink. As she is flying 
around looking for one Madcap throws himself off a tall building and splats on 
the ground below. Madcap pops up and Impossible Woman likes his humor. She asks

is dangerous because of his powers. The kid manages to snap Quasar out of it. 
Madcap escapes down a manhole.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Captain America #442- Cap sends his two sidekicks Jack Flag and 
Free Spirit out to enjoy some personal time, but they hear screams. They find 
Madcap strapped with explosives in the park. Madcap says that he has lost the 
will to live, and that even random acts seem pointless. Jack Flag climbs up to 
talk to Madcap. Jack puts Madcap in a full nelson. He says that he doesn’t care 
if Madcap wants to kill himself, but he doesn’t want him ruining the park. 
Madcap asks if he is Smokey the Bear. Jack says that he is Jack Flag. Madcap 
says that Jack doesn’t know jack about him if he thinks a full nelson can stop 
him. Madcap says that he is triple jointed and pushes the detonator. The bomb 
explodes. Madcap says, “smokin’” as he starts to get up. Free Spirit rushes to 
Jack’s aid. Jack says that he can heal from it. Madcap says that he can’t 
believe everyone is trying to steal his act. Jack says that he is getting Madcap 
committed.</FONT></P>

src="Madcap_files/ghostriderv3-33.jpg" width=256 align=right></FONT><FONT 
size=2> In the Soho loft that serves as a studio for the Madcap Comedy Hour, 
Madcap speaks about how his message isn’t reaching the people as he randomly 
stabs a knife through various parts of his body. He says that it is time to take 
his message out to the people. A short time later Madcap is in Grand Central 
Station dancing about on the ticket sales station. A cop yells at Madcap to get 
down. Madcap says that there is no reason to be a mad-cop. He says that in fact 
there is no reason to be anything. Madcap stares into the cop’s eyes and drives 
him mad. The cop starts shooting. He hits Madcap twice in the chest knocking him 
to the ground. The cop starts to randomly shoot in the station. A little later 
Ghost Rider is drawn inside when one of the people from the station leaps 
through a window saying, “It just doesn’t matter” over and over. Ghost Rider 
enters and says that the madness must stop, but Madcap says that the madness has 
only begun. He says that life has no meaning or value. Ghost Rider begs to 
differ saying that human life has value and is worth preserving. Madcap says 
that he has heard of Ghost Rider and asks what could be more meaningless than 
avenging blood that has already been spilled and people who are already dead. 
Ghost Rider’s chain wraps around Madcap’s neck. Madcap says that the dead people 
don’t care that they are avenged. Madcap’s necks snaps and Ghost Rider says, 
“Vengeance has been served.” Madcap looks up and asks when breakfast is going to 
be served. Madcap tries to drive Ghost Rider mad with his stare, but it has no 
effect. Ghost Rider says that Madcap needs his penance stare to feel the pain he 
has inflicted on others. Madcap welcomes him to try, but as he tells Ghost Rider 
that he doesn’t feel pain he is stopped by intense pain. Madcap collapses on the 
ground shouting “The pain! The pain! The pain!” Ghost Rider rides off to save 
someone. As Madcap recovers he thrills in the first pain he has felt since the 
accident. He says that it must not end here, and that no matter how much 
innocent blood is spilled he must be made to feel pain again.</FONT></P>
