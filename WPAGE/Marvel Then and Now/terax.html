    Powers: Terrax possessed vast cosmic power granted him by Galactus. Terrax's 
    body was coated with a flexible rock-like shell that was impervious to 
    extremes of heat and cold, from 50 degrees above absolute zero to the 
    interior of a small sun, pressure up to 100 Earth atmospheres, and 
    concessive force up to a fall at terminal velocity from the limit of Earth's 
    exosphere. His body had been sustained by cosmic energy, making it 
    unnecessary for him to eat or breathe. Terrax's strength had been augmented 
    by Galactus to unable him to lift (press) 75 tons without supplementing it 
    in any way by additional cosmic energy.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Terrax's mutant ability to psionically manipulate rock and earth was 
    augmented by Galactus's transformation at least a hundredfold. Terrax could 
    move planetary masses up to 100 miles in diameter. He could move asteroids 
    of miles in diameter at speeds of up to thousands of miles per hour. He 
    could control the direction of a swarm of meteors within a 100 miles of his 
    person. With concentration, he could affect a small piece of matter 1000 
    miles away from him. The farther the distance, however the less mass he was 
    able to affect. Standing on a planetary surface, he could affect tectonic 
    plates sufficiently to cause earthquakes and create chasms in the surface 
    thousands of feet deep or wide. Deploying his powers to the maximum extent, 
    he could separate a landmass the size of Manhattan Island and levitate it 
    miles off the Earth's surface. On worlds with lesser gravities, he could 
    lift even greater masses.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Terrax, like all of Galactus's heralds was able to enter warp-space and 
    negotiate through it in order to cover great spatial distances. Traversing 
    through the normal universe, he was able to attain .75 the speed of light.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Paraphernalia: Terrax wielded a cosmic axe which had several powers of it's 
    own. It was capable of emanating waves of destructive force sufficiently 
    powerful to rent a tear in Galactus's own ship. It could also project highly 
    impervious force shields. Since it operated independently of rock and earth, 
    the axe augmented the scope of Terrax's powers.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    History: Tyros was originally the dictator of the small city-state Lanlak on 
    the world of Brij (sometimes translated as Terran), a moon of the gas giant 
    Marman in a solar system eighty thousand light years from Earth. Tyros ruled 
    through the use of force, his limited power over earth and rock. This power, 
    which apparently was a mutation unique to Tyros, enabled him to animate 
    constructs of stone which would patrol his kingdom maintaining his firm 
    control. Tyros loved power and conquest, and led a life of debauchery and 
    violence. Somehow, he came to the attention of Galactus, the world devourer. 
    Galactus had been seeking a new herald to guide him to fertile planets which 
    he needed for sustenance. The space being surmised that the common fault in 
    most of his former heralds was that their moral values prevented them from 
    fulfilling their duties. For a new herald, Galactus sought an individual who 
    would have no compunction in finding worlds for Galactus to render lifeless.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    When the Fantastic Four came to Galactus to ask him for aid in the battle 
    against the Sphinx, Galactus agreed, but only with the condition that the 
    Fantastic Four would journey to Brij and subdue Tyros for him. The Fantastic 
    Four reluctantly did this, and in doing so, they freed the city of Lanlak 
    from Tyros's rule. Brought before Galactus Tyros was exposed to Galactus's 
    cosmic power, and was transformed into Terrax the Tamer. His minor control 
    over stone was augmented to an incalculable degree. Now, he could affect all 
    matter of rock and stone on nearly a planetary scale. His body was changed 
    so that it would withstand the vacuum of space. Finally, Galactus gave 
    Terrax a weapon called the &quot;cosmic axe,&quot; capable of generating waves of 
    cosmic force.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    As Galactus's new herald, Terrax found more worlds for his master than any 
    of the previous heralds. Terrax likened the discovery of new planets to the 
    feeling of conquest. On several occasions, Terrax annihilated large segments 
    of the population himself using his cosmic powers. As Galactus had hoped, 
    Terrax's lack of morality made him a successful herald. But whereas 
    Galactus's other heralds had a sense of loyalty to their master, Terrax had 
    none. Indeed, he served Galactus out of fear for his master's power, but 
    even conquered that fear on several occasions to defy Galactus's wishes. 
    Shortly after being transformed into Galactus's herald, Terrax fled from his 
    master and overthrew the ruling body of a small unnamed planet. He enslaved 
    the the entire population and set him self up as the planet's deity. Huge 
    segments of that worlds people died erecting temples and cities to glorify 
    Terrax. Terrax planned to use the survivors of his reign as the first wave 
    of a universe-conquering army. But before Terrax could proceed any farther, 
    Galactus summoned his herald. Fearful of his master's wrath, Terrax hid in a 
    black hole. Utilizing the powers of the Earth mutant Dazzler, Galactus freed 
    Terrax and made him obedient to his will again.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    But Terrax's rebellious nature could not be totally stifled, and after a 
    while, Terrax again fled his master. This time he went to Earth. Utilizing 
    his power, Terrax levitated the entire island of Manhattan into Earth orbit 
    and used the lives of its millions of inhabitants to bargain with the 
    Fantastic Four. To spare Manhattan, Terrax demanded that they destroy 
    Galactus by attacking his ship. Galactus had by now realized that his herald 
    had become a liability to him. Returning Manhattan to Earth, Galactus 
    stripped Terrax of his cosmic power and the transformed alien was sent 
    hurtling from the top of the world trade center down to the street below. 
    Although seriously injured, Terrax's alien physique enabled him to survive 
    the fall. Unknown to both the Fantastic Four and the Avengers, who were 
    present at the site. Terrax's broken form was taken to a nearby hospital by 
    an unidentified passer by. He remained there for several months in a 
    semi-comatose state.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Victor Von Doom, looking for a pawn to use in a plot against the Fantastic 
    Four, discovered the fact of Terrax's survival. Terrax was kidnapped from 
    the hospital and brought back to Latveria by a squad of robots dispatched by 
    Doom. There, after six weeks of Doom's advanced treatments, Terrax 
    recovered. But, having been stripped of cosmic power, Terrax had no memories 
    of having been the herald of Galactus, and thus called himself Tyros once 
    more. Doom had recently perfected a device that was capable of endowing an 
    individual with limited cosmic power. Tyros readily agreed to be exposed to 
    the device's energies, as he wished revenge against the Fantastic Four. 
    Garbed in a special suit that would channel and regulate the cosmic energies 
    in his body, Tyros set off for New York. Unknown to him, the power Doom gave 
    him would consume Tyros's body within a matter of hours. Thus, Doom would 
    not be faced with an adversary whose power was vaster than his own, once 
    Tyros had served his purpose.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Tyros defeated the Fantastic Four and , detesting the fact he was in the 
    service of any master, he turned on Doom and immobilized the Latverian 
    monarch in his armor. At Tyros's moment of seeming triumph, the Silver 
    Surfer, first of Galactus's heralds,arrived to save the lives of his 
    friends, the Fantastic Four. Tyros believed that his power level was equal 
    to that of the Surfer's but Tyros was no match for someone who had received 
    cosmic power from Galactus himself. Because of this, Tyros was forced to use 
    his powers to the limit in order to combat the Surfer. This only served to 
    hasten the deterioration of the cosmic power Doom had embued him with. As 
    the two former heralds of Galactus engaged in battle, Tyros appeared to be 
    totally consumed by the &quot;power cosmic.&quot; Though many thought him dead, Terrax 
    had merely been stripped of the Power Doom had given him. Terrax remained in 
    hiding for many years afterwards to avoid punishment for his crimes.Real
