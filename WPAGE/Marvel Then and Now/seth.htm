<img border="0" src="seth.jpg" align="left" width="410" height="618">Seth is the Egyptian God of Death. The son of Osiris and Isis, and 
brother to Horus, Seth’s power began to grow as his family’s faded when the 
Romans conquered the Egyptians. Seth grew so powerful that he cast his family 
out of Heaven and he reigned there for several millennia. It wasn’t until Osiris 
and the others enlisted the aid of Odin and Thor that they managed to take back 
Heaven from Seth. Seth nearly killed Thor with his touch of Death, but before he 
could do so Odin blasted Seth’s hand off. Seth was cast out of Heaven and Asgard 
earned a new enemy.</font></P>
