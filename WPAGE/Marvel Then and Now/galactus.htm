<BR><BR>HISTORY <BR><BR>Galan was born on the planet of Taa, the 
most advanced planet in the history of its Universe. Galan matured into one of 
that planet’s foremost explorers and greatest minds. His civilizations main goal 
to search out new knowledge. On one of his many journeys he was witness to a 
“creeping plague” that was apparently killing all multi-cellular organisms of 
that universe, Galan desired to warn his planet of the coming plague. When he 
returned, it was too late, the plague was already nearing Taa. Once on Taa, and 
with all of that planet’s resources at his disposal, he realized that the 
“creeping plague” was a form of radiation, now engulfing the entire universe, 
resulting from the universe’s nearing end and entropy He realized that there was 
no hope for survival, so he gathered his faithful crew, boarded a mighty 
starship, and raced for the Cosmic Egg of the universe, the source of the 
radiation. They wished to die in a blaze of glory, a death befitting the last 
sons of Taa. As they rocketed into the heart of the universe, his ship was 
immediately engulfed. All of his crew fell instantly, but Galan remained, 
feeling a new life, an infinite presence, bursting from within the center of his 
being.&nbsp;</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>In what seemed like days the sentience of that previous 
universe spoke to Galan, it said “Hear me last son of Taa! I am the sentience of 
the universe. As I mark time, I shall draw all the matter in the cosmos into my 
bosom and collapse beneath my own abysmal weight. Though we both must die, we 
need not die without an heir. Come, surrender yourself to my fiery embrace, let 
us become as one, let our death throes serve as the birth pangs for a new form 
of life!” And so the embodiment of the previous universe became one with Galan, 
and formed the all-powerful World Devourer, Galactus!&nbsp;</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>The ship roamed universe for centuries until it finally came 
into orbit around a planet called Archeopia. Within the ship, Galactus labored, 
creating his armor and transforming the ship itself into an incubator, which 
would allow him to attain mature and attain mastery over his awesome power. The 
inhabitants of Archeopia were curious as to the incubators contents, but dared 
not disturb it, for fear of releasing the “unknown”. There it remained in orbit 
for centuries until an intergalactic war brought an enemy armada to Archeopia. 
The fleet, seeing Galactus' incubator, believed it to be a massive weapon of 
Arheopian origin, so they shot at it, awaking Galactus. Galactus quickly emerged 
from his slumber and destroyed the fleet with a gesture. He then realized he now 
had an uncontrollable Hunger, and instinctively engulfed Archeopia with that 
Hunger. Galactus saw the carnage he caused, and it moved him to despair. He 
began to ask philosophical questions about his very nature, which would one day 
be answered, as we all know. So, with his incomprehensible power, he sought to 
surpass the glory of Taa from the ashes of his first act of destruction. And so, 
Worldship was born, the construction of which took a millennia.&nbsp;</FONT></b></P>
<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>Worldship, also known as Taa 2, was so large that entire 
planet’s orbited it! Galactus still must roam the universe seeking out new 
planets to satiate his Hunger however, for it is his cosmic duty and ultimate 
tragedy that is Galactus. And this is how Galactus, all-powerful devourer of 
worlds, came to be. Woe to all the worlds he shall encounter! Now, however, we 
must address Galactus' history “in” the Marvel Universe. His history is long, 
and spans the Marvel Universe from it's very beginnings. Before Galactus came to 
Earth, he tried to feed on the planet Zenn-La, wherein a brave and noble soul, 
known as Norrin Radd, gave himself to Galactus and served as his herald, so long 
as he would spare his home world of Zenn-La. Galactus accepted the offer, and 
has kept his word.&nbsp;</FONT></b></font></P>
