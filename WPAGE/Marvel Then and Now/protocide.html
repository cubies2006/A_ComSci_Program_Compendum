behavior department. In fact he was participating in PROJECT: PROTOTYPE because 
he figured it was preferable to being shot for killing his commanding officer. 
McIntyre took the serum without Erskine's knowledge and died because the formula 
was incomplete. Decades later McIntyre would be revived by A.I.M. (Advanced 
Ideas Mechanics). Protocide was led to believe that Captain America killed him 
to usurp his position in the hearts of America.</font></b></P>
