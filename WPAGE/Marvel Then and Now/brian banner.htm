conquering egomaniacs, money hungry thugs, and just plain madmen. But despite 
that the most evil person on this board might just be one Brian Banner. Brian 
Banner beat his wife and child. One day in a fit of rage Brian killed his wife 
the beautiful Rebecca. Brian was a victim of abuse himself. He was also a victim 
of alcohol. He was a also a victim of his own paranoia. He was convinced that 
the atomic research he did gave him a mutant for a son. A freak. Brian knew that 
his son was a monster. He just didn't realize he would be the one to make him 
that way. Abuse, alcohol, paranoia. "Victims...aren't we all?"</font></b></P>
