face=ARIAL><BR><B>Spider-Man Profile</B> <BR><BR>Spider-Man is the 
quintessential Marvel character. Although a super hero, he is spared none of the 
slings and arrows of ordinary life; he experiences difficulties with friends, 
family, sweethearts and employers. His powers enable him to do good, but not to 
improve his own lot in life, and it is his simple humanity, rather than his 
exotic talent, that has won him millions of enthusiastic fans. He is one 
super-hero who has not lost the common touch, and in fact he is frequently 
described as "your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man." <BR><BR>In his 1962 debut, 
Spider-Man took to fighting crime for a reason commonplace in comc books: he was 
motivated by the murder of a father figure, his Uncle Ben. Yet Spidey's driving 
force is guilt, not revenge; he must live forever with the knowledge that he 
could have prevented the killing if he had not been so self absorbed. Perhaps he 
suffers from a classic Oedipus complex; in any case he is certainly neurotic, 
forever agonizing over the choices that confront him when he attempts to do the 
right thing. Despite his best efforts, he is viewed with a touch of suspicion by 
those in authority, and is sometimes considered little more than a criminal 
himself. <BR><BR>Although nobody seems to understand him, Spider-Man has the 
spirit to be a joker as well as a tragic figure. He is quick with a quip, 
appreciates the irony of his endless predicaments, and relishes the chance to 
play tricks on people who never suspect that he and Peter Parker are one and the 
same. <BR><BR>As originally depicted by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, 
Peter Parker was just a bit of a wimp. Bright, imaginative, but nonetheless an 
alienated adolescent, he might well have been a typical comic book reader. 
Although he has matured and gained in confidence over the years. Spidey is still 
all to human. He misses appointments, catches the flu when he needs to fight, 
forgets to put film in his camera and has trouble paying the rent. In short 
Spider-Man remains Everyman, "the super hero who could be you." <BR><BR>

align=left> <B>Caught in the web</B> <BR>The first Spider-Man story was 
originally intended as no more than a one-shot experiment, and almost didn't get 
into print at all. "Martin Goodman didn't want to publish it," recalls Stan Lee. 
Goodman was convinced that readers would find the subject of spiders 
distasteful. <BR><BR>Fortunately for all concerned, a comic book called 
<I>Amazing Fantasy</I> was about to be canceled due to faltering sales. "Nobody 
cares what you put in a book that's going to die," Lee says, "so I threw in 
Spider-Man. I featured him on the cover and then forgot about him." For the 
occasion the comic book reverted to its original title of <I>Amazing 
Fantasy</I>, an appropriate amendment since Spider-Man was to be the most 
important adolescent super hero in comics. <BR><IMG height=125 
alt="Spiderman Bust" src="SpiderMan Biography, History_files/SpidermanBust.gif" 
width=100 align=right> <BR>Spider-Man was the hero and teenage helper rolled 
into one; he was his own sidekick. Marvel's first editor, Joe Simon, theorized 
that kid companions like Captain America's Bucky were important because they 
gave the protagonist someone to talk to; Spider-man talked to himself. In fact 
he has delivered more siloquies than Hamlet. In his first appearance he mused 
out loud but subsequently Lee adopted the device of the thought balloon with its 
characteristic bubbles. "I used those thought balloons to help the exposition," 
says Lee. "I could put interesting thoughts there that weren't necessarily about 
what ws happening in that particular panel - something to hold the reader's 
interest." <BR><BR>Spider-Man, despite the fact that he was not originally 
intended to star ina series, became the epitome of the radical innovations that 
characterized The Marvel Age. Lee used him to challenge the very concept of the 
super hero. Spider-Man was neurotic, compulsive and profoundly skeptical about 
the whole idea of becoming a costumed savior. The Fantastic Four argued with 
each other, and The Hulk and Thor had problems with their alter egos, but 
Spider-Man had to struggle with himself. <BR><BR><IMG height=179

src="SpiderMan Biography, History_files/SpidermanVideo.gif" width=100 
align=left> In the original story (August 1962), Peter Parker is a bookish, 
bespectacled high school student, isolated and unpopular. An orphan, he lives 
with his elderly relatives, Aunt May and Uncle Ben. While attending a science 
exhibit, Peter is bitten by a spider that has accidentally received a dose of 
radioactivity. As a result, Peter acquires the agility and proportionate 
strength of an arachnid. He sews his own super hero uniform and uses his 
scientific knowledge to build mechanical devices that eject sticky webbing, but 
he is less interested in fighting crime than in making a buck. Disguised as 
Spider-Man, he becomes a professional wrestler and then demonstrates his 
abilities on television. Hw blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief, 
but his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later 
robs and kills Uncle Ben. Eventually Spider-Man subdues the murderer, but for a 
tearful Peter Parker, there is no peace. He wanders remorsefully off into the 
night to the accompan iment of Lee's now famous caption: <B>"With great Power 
there must also come - great responsibility!"</B> <BR><BR>This story, with its 
challenge to comic book clichés, created an unexpected sensation. "A few months 
later," Lee recalls, "we got the sales figures, and that Spider-Man issue of 
<I>Amazing Fantasy</I> was one of the best selling books we ever had. There were 
no flies on us, so we put him out in his own title." However, the usual months 
of creative and production work leading to publication kept <THE I Spider-Man< 
Amazing>#1 from appearing until March 1963. <BR><BR>Until this time Jack Kirby 
had been drawing all of the company's new characters, but Spider-Man ended up in 
the hands of another artist. Kirby drew several pages of a version of 
Spider-Man, but he never completed a story. Kirby's version was as bold and 
dynamic as the rest of his work, but Lee wanted something a bit more offbeat and 
edgy. Steve Ditko was the artist to provide it, an Lee asked him to illustrate 
the initial Spider-Man adventure. The now famous cover for the first story was 
drawn by Kirby and Ditko together. "Steve Ditko was a fine artist, " says Kirby, 
"and he did a fine job on Spider-Man". <BR><BR>Born in 1927 in Johnstown, 
Pennsylvania, Ditko had already won a cult following with the dark moody tales 
he had illustrated for comic books like <I>Amazing Adult Fantasy.</I> An 
intensely private individual who shuns personal publicity and consistently 
refuses interviews, Ditko has always preferred to let his work speak for itself. 
The analogy to Peter Parker working behind the mask of Spider-Man may not be 
entirely inappropriate. Ditko was the perfect choice to depict the new 
<U>antihero</U>, a skinny kid who just didn't know what to do with the 
extraordinary gift that had unexpectedly come his way. "Steve was every bit as 
inventive as Jack Kirby was," says Lee. "He always added so much." As time went 
on, Ditko also began to contribute significantly to the plotting of the stories. 
From the very start, Ditko's sensitive, humanistic portrayal of the beleaguered 
Peter Parker was enough to alter the look of the medium forever: he brought a 
touch of realism into a world of fantasy. <BR><BR><B>Peter Parker - His Life and 
history</B><BR>Peter Parker was only a young boy when his parents died in a 
plane crash. He immediately moved in with his fathers older brother and wife. 
Ben and Mary Parker were an elderly couple with no children of their own, and 
they raised Peter as if he were their son. They rarely spoke about Peter's real 
parents, so Peter became convinced that his parents had left him because of 
something he had done. Afraid of being abandoned, Peter worked hard to win his 
uncle's approval - though he didn't have to worry. Ben and MAry truly loved 
their nephew and would have done anything to please him.<BR><BR><B>High 
School</B><BR>Peter was an honor student, and his teachers always thought very 
highly of him. He always came prepared for class, and completed all of his 
asignments. The other students , however, had little time for a know-it-all like 
puny Peter. The girls thought he was too quiet, and the boys considered him a 
wimp. Peter was pinfully shy, and some of his classmates misinterpreted his 
silence for snobbery. He had trouble making friends, but never stopped trying. 
He often invited other students to join him at science exhibits or monster 
movies. But they usually responded with ridicule, and almost never asked him to 
join them.<BR><BR>May Parker insisted that peter wear glasses, but after he 
became Spider-Man his eyesight improved. Flash Thompson broke Peter's last pair 
of glasses during a shoving match, and Peter never got around to buying a new 
pair. Before hi gained his spider powers, Peter had considerably less than 
average strength for a boy of his age. Clumsy and uncoordinated, he also had no 
athletic ability. He had a fear of heights - even getting a book from the top 
shelf in the library resulted in his suffering severe symptoms of 
vertigo.<BR><BR>Peter always thought of his Uncle Ben as his best friend. Ben 
had an extensive collection of old comic books and science fiction magazines 
that he enjoyed sharing with his nephew. Peter spent hours reading these comics 
and their stories about outrageous heroes and their intriguing adventures. He 
dreamed of being a costumed adventurer like Captain America, striking terror in 
the hearts of criminals.<BR><BR>Peter Parker graduated from Midtown High with 
the highest scholastic average in the school's history, but he almost missed the 
ceremony. Instead of attending to last minute graduation details, Peter was 
trading punches with a superhuman villain, the <B>Molten Man.</B> He won his 
fight and arrived home just in time to change for the ceremony. Later, he was 
thrilled to discover that he had won a full scholarship to Empire State 
University. <BR><BR><B>College<BR></B>Fascinated with science ever since Uncle 
Ben took him to his first monster movie, Peter Parker immersed himself in his 
studies. Despite web swinging and a hectic social life, he was determined to be 
success and to make his Aunt May proud. Peter was more self confident in college 
than he had been in high school. Leaving home for the first time, he moved into 
a bachelor pad and even bought a motorcycle. Spider- Man ruined Peter's college 
graduation. In the week before the ceremony, Spidey was battling the Green 
Goblin and the Rocket Racer. He couldn't graduate with the rest of his class 
since he'd missed a required gym class.<BR><BR>Peter finally got his degree from 
Empire State University, but he continued his studies as a graduate student, and 
took a job as a teaching assistant. With all these activities, as well as being 
Spider- Man, Peter's life got a little too hectic. He decided he needed a rest, 
and he withdrew from the graduate program. Later, taking Aunt May's advice, he 
returned to college and continued working toward his master's degree. 
<BR><BR>Throughout his career as Spider-Man, Peter has always been torn between 
his sense of duty and the mixed feelings he has received from the public. This 
reception has varied from praise to outright condemnation, and it has left the 
teenager confused about his role. It has even driven him to the brink of 
despair, causing him to throw away his costume and renounce his alter ego. 
Nevertheless, his dedication to using his powers responsibly has always led to 
Peter donning the mask again in the hope that some day the world will learn to 
appreciate Spider-Man.<BR><BR><B><U>Spider-Man's Powers</U><BR><BR>His 
Spider-Sense</B><BR>He may not know if you've been bad or good, but he can 
always sense when you're dangerous. Spider- Man possesses many incredible 
abilities, but his most amazing power must be his uncanny spider-sense. This 
strange tingling sensation, which originates in the back of his skull, warns him 
of danger. The danger could be something immediate, like a gun being aimed at 
him or a punch being thrown at the back of his head. Or it could be something 
subtle, like a slippery floor or a sandwich that contains tainted meat. While 
his spider-sense cannot tell Spider-Man the exact nature of a particular threat, 
it always lets him know when and which way to move in order to avoid the 
danger.<BR><BR>Spider-Man's spider sense is like having a personal radar unit. 
He doesn't have to worry about watching where he's walking or web-swinging 
because it always guides him away from danger. Loose ceiling tiles or rotted 
roof tops don't trouble Spider-Man because his spider-sense warns him in plenty 
of time to avoid them. Even if he were trapped in complete darkness, hi 
spider-sense would prevent him from bumping into anything. And Spidey's 
spider-sense tingles if someone can see the web-slinger out of costume, warning 
him that he may be spotted.<BR><BR>Like a Geiger counter that somehow reacts to 
danger, Spider-Man often uses his spider-sense to track down enemies. He has 
also developed special spider-tracers that are attuned to his spider-sense and 
can help him to pinpoint foes who are far away. Thanks to his spider-sense, it's 
practically impossible to sneak up on Spider-Man to ambush him. Not only can he 
sense the exact direction of an impending threat, but his spider-sense 
immediately triggers his amazing reflexes to help him avoid injury. He often 
dodges blows before they are actually thrown. ...Its one weakness is its 
inability to detect <B><I>Carnage</I></B> and <B><I>Venom.</I></B><BR><BR>Since 
his spider-sense instinctively reacts to trouble, Spider-Man depends on it most 
when he is in a fight, weaving his way through a hail of bullets without a 
scratch. Over the years he has come to realize that his reflexes work a lot 
faster than his mind. Because he can trust his Spider quick reflexes completely, 
Spidey is free to come up with the witty one-liners he spouts to distract his 
opponents.<BR><BR><B>Wall Crawling</B><BR>Nothing seems to unnerve a bad guy 
more than being approached by a certain webbed crime-fighter who is crawling up 
the side of a nearby wall. Though Spider-Man possesses many amazing powers, his 
ability to cling to any surface is certainly the most unsettling. No matter how 
friendly our neighborhood web-slinger claims to be, the sight of him scurrying 
across the ceiling can be very distracting. The fact that he looks like a 
monstrous insect whenever he scampers up a building helped Daily Bugle publisher 
J. Jonah Jameson convince the public that Spider-Man is a menace. Many people 
hate spiders, and are easily frightened by someone who can hang from their 
ceilings and cling to their walls.<BR><BR>No one knows exactly how Spider-Mans 
wall clinging ability works. Peter Parker has often theorized that he has a form 
of bio-magnetic power that allows him to increase the attraction between the 
molecules in his body with those of the surface he climbs. All that is known for 
certain is that he can stick to anything. No matter how smooth or slippery a 
surface may be, Spidey can attach himself. He just has to keep concentrating 
until he can bond with it. Unlike his spider-sense, the web heads clinging 
power is strictly a conscious act. He can never stick to something by accident. 
He must deliberately press his hand to an object and chose to adhere to it. Of 
course, Spidey likes to show off as much as the next fellow. He occasionally 
likes to run upside down along a ceiling or strides up a wall. <BR><BR>Once 
Spider-Man has latched on to an object, only he can decide when to release it. 
No outside force has managed to pry him from a surface if he consciously wants 
to stick to it. Foes with superhuman strength have been known to rip Spidey from 
walls and ceilings, but thats only because these surfaces have shattered under 
the strain. Chunks of drywall or pieces of ceiling tile can usually be spotted 
clinging to Spidey whenever this situation occurs. If someone as strong as the 
Incredible Hulk were to try to pull Spider-Man off a slab of granite, he might 
accidentally rip off the web-spinners arms before the rock would splinter. Of 
course, there is an easy way to separate Spider-Man from an object. All a 
villain has to do is find a way to knock him out. Once Spidey has lost 
consciousness, his body will automatically go limp and detach itself from 
anything it is holding.<BR><BR>Though Spider-Man tends to focus on his hands and 
his feet whenever he is climbing up a wall, every part of his body has the same 
clinging ability. His back and head can stick to surfaces as easily as his 
fingers and toes. All he has to do is lean against something and he will stick 
to it until he decides to free himself.<BR><BR><B>Strength and 
Agility</B><BR>Shortly after he was bitten by the radioactive spider that gave 
him his amazing powers, Peter Parker accidentally crushed a steel pipe as if it 
were made of paper. He was astonished to discover that he now possessed 
superhuman strength. Since then, Spider-Man has often told people that he has 
the proportional strength of a spider; but hes actually a lot more powerful. 
While not as strong as the Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, or The Thing, our 
friendly neighborhood web-slinger is able to lift almost 10 tons. He can bend a 
solid iron bar with his bare hands and shatter a concrete wall with a single 
punch. And in one, spider-powered spring, he has leapt the height of three 
stories, or the width of a highway. <BR><BR>Even more impressive than his 
spiderlike strength is Spider-Mans amazing speed and agility. When it comes to 
quick thinking, death-defying, lightning swift, acrobatic stunts, the wall 
crawling wonder is truly without equal. Spider-Man moves with a fluid and casual 
grace that cant even be equaled by trained superathletes such as Captain 
America or Daredevil. He leaps from rooftops, summersaults over flagpoles, 
tumbles off water towers, and balances on top of light poles as he routinely 
travels across the city in his own unique manner. <BR><BR>Average people have 
been known to lift cars in times of stress. Spider-Man can raise a couple of 
Cadillacs on a normal day. Add in the excitement of one of his typical battles, 
and his power level can shoot into uncharted territory. Over the years the 
web-slinger has been seen holding up multistory buildings, freeing himself from 
beneath tons of debris, and flattening cosmically powered 
aliens.<BR><BR>Spider-Man's reflexes operate up to forty times faster than those 
of a normal person, and he uses them to dazzle much stronger foes. Faced by the 
Rhino or even the Hulk, Spider-Man kicks into high gear ricocheting off the 
walls, ceiling, and ground to barrage his opponent with blow after blow. THe 
victim, dazed by the wall-crawler's speed, is left punching thin 
air.<BR><BR><B>Web-Slinging</B><BR>Every Spider needs a web, and Spider-Man is 
no exception. Shortley after he gained his amazing powers, Peter Parker set out 
to create a web of his own. Peter used his high school's science laboritory 
after hours and, having studied multipolimer compounds for a few years, he 
produced an adhesive fluid capable of imitating a spider's silk webbing. TO 
complete the mechanism, Peter then designed and built a pair of web-shooters 
that snapped on his wrists.<BR><BR>Peter has improved upon his initial design. 
He now switches between different forms of webbing by the way he taps his 
trigger. With a short second tap he releases a thin cable like strand that is 
perfect for web-swinging. A longer second tap increases the strand's thickness 
for additional support. If Spiey prolongs the pressure on the fluid, web fluid 
squirts out in the form of an adhesive liquid which can paste a foe against a 
wall. A series of brisk taps discharges many thin strands that form a fine spray 
of webbing, perfect for blinding an opponent.<BR><BR>Peter designed his 
web-shooters so that he wouldn't accidentally fire them every time he made a 
fist. Resting in the palm of his hand, the trigger works just like a computer's 
mouse. He must tap twice in rapid succession to release his webbing. The web 
fluid is almost solid in its natural state. The spinneret {mechanism in the web 
shooters} cuts the solid fluid into thin strands. Each web shooter has one 
web-fluid cartridge locked in, plus nine spares.<BR><BR>Though Peter Parker 
built the original pair of web-shooters, he now splits up the designs for the 
various parts and sends them to a number of different machine shops in the New 
York area. To maintain a degree of secrecy, Peter later assembles all of the 
pieces himself. Peter has also designed a special utility belt to carry his 
spare cartridges of web fluid. {The belt can carry 30 cartridges of web-fluid.} 
The buckle of the belt contains a spider signal which can be projected onto his 
opponents. Sometimes Peter equips te buckle with a miniature camera. <BR><BR>The 
pressure in Spider-Man's web-cartridges is enough to propel a single strand of 
webbing up to 50 yards, but thicker strands and more complex web patterns can't 
reach nearly as far. Each of his web-shooters has ten cartridges, and each 
cartridge contains approximately 1,000 yards of single-strand webbing. [The] web 
begins to harden the instant it is exposed to air. Given enough time and 
sufficient thickness, one strand could even bind the incredible Hulk and hold 
him prisoner - although it's hard to imagine the Hulk standing still while 
Spidey applies the necessary webbing!<BR><BR>Spidey's normal webbing can easily 
withstand temperaturs of 1,000 degrees Farenheit. It melts, but it has never 
caught on fire. If the wall-crawler is preparing to fight someone like the Human 
TOrch, he can pack a webbing which resists temperatures of up to 10,000 degrees 
Farenheit. This type can only be released in strands that are as thick as a 
clothesline. Its special cartridge can only hold 10 yards of the webbing at a 
time.<BR><BR><B><U>Costumes</U></B><BR>If clothes make the man, a distinctive 
costume is a definite must for a budding young super-hero. Of course, Peter 
Parker didn't intend to be a crime fighter when he first gained his amazing 
powers - he wanted to go into show business, and he needed an exciting look to 
match his stage act. Peter learned thatMidtown High's dance class was throwing 
out some old bodysuits. Slipping into the school after dark, he found one that 
fit him, took it to the art room, and spent a few hours silkscreening a web 
pattern on the shirts. He also made a skin tight pair of gloves and boots, and 
with some one way mirrors he found in the drama class's old prop box, he now had 
a mask. His first spider-costume was finally ready.<BR><BR>Having the perfect 
costume is one thing, keeping it is another matter. Peter Parker and his trusty 
sewing needle have spent many hours repairing the numerous rips and tears his 
costume has received in battle. Aunt May also contributed to Pete's costume 
woes. She once found his costume behind the bookcase where he had hidden it. 
Though Peter claimed it was for a practical joke on his friends, she refused to 
return it. He was forced to buy a Spider-Man suit from a local costume shop. The 
imitation was so cheap that it began to shrink and come apart during one of his 
many conflicts.<BR><BR>Spider-Man's boots and gloves consist of a thin layer of 
material so that they do not inhibit his ability to stick to walls. Spidey can 
[also] see out through his white eyepieces, but no one can see in. Running from 
his elbows to his waist, Spidey's underarm webbing is made of a flexible nylon 
netting. Beneath his costume's shirt, Spider-Man wears a belt that contains his 
spider-signal, a miniature camera, and spare web artridges. He keeps meaning to 
add a change purse, but has never gotten around to it. The major disadvantage of 
a skintight costume is that there's no room for Peter's street clothes. He 
either webs them into a ball attached to his back or he leaves them 
behind.<BR><BR><B>The Alien Costume</B><BR>[In the Secret-Wars] Spider-Man found 
himself on a satellite in a galexy far from Earth. Along with other super 
heroes, such as Captain America, and super villains, including Dr. Doom, Spidey 
was brought to the satellite by a near-omnipotent being called the Beyonder. The 
Beyonder wanted heroes and villains to fight a war on a planet called 
Battleworld. [There] Spider-Man fought many battles and his costume was left in 
tatters then he found a machine that could replace ruined clothing. SPider-Man 
triggered the clothing machine and a round black object sprang from it. It 
immediately started to spread up Spidey's arm, and didn't stop until it covered 
his entire body.<BR><BR>After defeating the villains and escaping the Beyonder, 
the heroes returned to Earth, and Spider-Man took his alien costume with him. 
The alien costume always seemed to know what Peter wanted, sometimes even before 
he did. He learned that his new supersuit was capable of generating a seemingly 
endless supply of webbing, and that it could also change its appearance at will. 
Peter and his alien costume were always in some kind of psychic contact, even 
when physically seperated. If the costume was in a different room, it came 
[slithered] at Peter's summons. [However] each night while Peter slept, the 
alien costume secretly slipped over him and took the unconscious Spider-Man 
wall-crawling at night. The web-swinger awoke each morning with no memory of his 
nocturnal adventures. All he knew was that he felt more exhausted before he had 
gone to bed.<BR><BR>As Peter's fatigue continued to grow he slept through the 
entire day and began to have terrible nightmares. So Spider-Man went to Reed 
Richards (Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four) for help. After an exhaustive 
series of tests, Mr. Fantastic made a startling pronouncement. Instead of an 
amazing suit made of some unknown extraterrestrial fabric, Spidey's new costume 
was actually a living creature. It was a sentient symbiote who had formed a 
mental and physical bond with the Web-Slinger. <BR><BR>As soon as the symbiote's 
secret was revealed, it attempted to permanently graft itself to SPider-Man's 
body. Spider-Man did all he could to escape from the costume, but the symbiote 
tightened its grip on him, almost crushing Spidey in the process. Luckily ,Reed 
Richards had discovered that the symbiote was vulnerable to certain sound 
frequencies. Using theses sound waves, Richards managed to seperate Spidey from 
the costume. At last our hero was free and the alien was 
imprisoned.<BR><BR>Later, [during a power failure] the symbiote escaped from the 
laboratory and pounced on the unsuspecting Spider-Man. In desperation, 
SPider-Man lured the alien to the bell tower of Our Lady of Saints Church. He 
knew that the sound of the bells could free him from the symbiote. The alien, 
knowing that only one of them could survive the ordeal, sacrificed itself to 
save Peter. [Rid of the old costume Spider-Man went back to his old look.] The 
Black Cat, however, thought the black costume was sexier [so] she made a cloth 
version of it as a gift for Spidey. He used both costumes for many months and 
didn't get rid of his black one until Venom entered his life.<BR><BR><B>The 
Clone Saga</B><BR>Shortly after Aunt May fell into her final coma, Mary Jane 
received a phone call from a young man who claimed to be an old friend of the 
family.
