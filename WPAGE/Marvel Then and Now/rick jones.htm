<P align="justify"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>History:<BIG> </BIG></STRONG><FONT size=3>Rick Jones 
was raised as an orphan in many orphanages. His life with heroes began when, as 
a teenager, he accepted a dare from some friends and drove onto a test site, 
where the government was planning an experiment on their gamma bomb. Dr. Bruce 
Banner noticed him and went out onto the site to rescue him. When the bomb went 
off, Jones was saved, but Banner was exposed to the radiation and transformed, 
as a result, into the Incredible Hulk. Since, the two have been close 
allies.</FONT></FONT></P><FONT size=3>
<P align="justify"><FONT face=Arial>Rick Jones is also responsible for the creation of the 
Avengers. When the evil Loki was controlling the Hulk, he called on Thor, Iron 
Man, Ant-Man, and the Wasp for assistance. Later on, the Avengers found Captain 
America, who had been frozen since World War II. Captain America then became 
closely related to the Avengers and, for a while, Rick Jones was his 
sidekick.</FONT></P>
<P align="justify"><FONT face=Arial>After they broke up, Rick Jones found himself drawn to a 
pair of Nega-Bands. When he placed the gold, cosmic bands on and slammed them 
together, his atoms were switched with those of Captain Mar-Vell, who was 
trapped in the Negative Zone.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P align="justify"><FONT face=Arial>The two soon found themselves involved in the Kree-Skrull 
War, which was later put to an end, when the Kree Supreme Intelligence unlocked 
psionic potential of Rick’s mind, called the Destiny Force.</FONT></P>
<P align="justify"><FONT face=Arial>Later on, Captain Mar-Vell died from cancer, from being 
exposed to a deadly nerve gas. Rick then went back to his association with the 
Hulk, where he met Marlo Jones. They had a good relationship, until a woman 
claiming to be Rick’s mother, who wasn’t really, killed Marlo. Rick was driven 
into a depression and sought the help of anyone who could help. The Leader, a 
villain of the Hulk’s, offered to revive her, but was only able to bring her 
into a deep coma state, before being stopped by a mad Hulk.</FONT></P>
<P align="justify"><FONT face=Arial>She eventually awoke and the two were married. They late 
started their own talk show called, "Keeping up with the Jones." Later, Hulk, 
absent of Bruce Banner due to the Onslaught incident, threw Rick Jones against a 
wall, paralyzing him. The incident, along with the death of Betty Banner, caused 
Rick to feel sorry for himself and isolate himself from his wife.</FONT></P>
<P align="justify"><FONT face=Arial>Rick’s Destiny Force powers then resurfaced, causing the 
Time Keepers to want Rick dead, so that they can wipe out humanity and prevent 
them from taking over other civilizations. Rick Jones calls seven Avengers from 
different times to his aid, one of which is a future Captain Marvel, who becomes 
an Avenger in the future. By the end of the war, they learn that the future 
Captain Marvel is actually Genis and Rick Jones combined. When Rick Jones 
becomes injured during battle, Captain Marvel merges with the present day Rick 
Jones.</FONT></P>
<P align="justify"><FONT face=Arial>When Rick Jones returns to the present reality, he finds 
Nega-Bands on his wrists. When he snaps them together, his atoms are replaced by 
the present day Genis, not the future one because of a temporal-flux. The 
bonding with Rick, causes Genis’s costume and body to change into how Captain 
Marvel in the future looks. Captain Marvel also has the new ability of cosmic 
awareness.</FONT></P>
