align=left> "The Fantastic Four are a group of super heroes who have experienced 
some of the wildest adventures ever depicted in comic books, but perhaps the 
root of their appeal is the extent to which they embodied the ideal family, 
warts and all. Bound together by the strange powers that each acquired while 
manning an experimental rocket, they are also joined by legal and blood 
relationships. <B>Reed Richards</B> and <B>Sue Storm</B> were engaged when the 
series began in <B>1961</B> and married a few years later; <B>Johnny Storm</B> 
is Sue's younger brother. The odd man out is <B>Ben Grimm,</B> ostensibly just a 
friend of the family, but really the heart and soul of the team.<BR><BR>Reed 
Richards developed a flexible, elastic body and became <B>Mr. fantastic,</B> but 
remained a brilliant and aloof scientist, more at home with his work than with 
people. Sue Storm, transformed into <B>The Invisible Girl (later Woman)</B>, 
maintained the air of middle-class matron. These two rather restrained 
characters were the symbolic parents of the group, while the adolescent Johnny, 
an updated version of <B>The Human Torch,</B> functioned as their spoiled son. 
Ben Grimm, who turned into the hideous but powerful <B>Thing,</B>appeared to be 
the family's gruff but lovable uncle, one who came from distinctly less 
privileged background. 
<P>In the original synopsis that writer-editor <B>Stan Lee</B> gave artist 
<B>Jack Kirby,</B> Lee proposed making the Thing into 'the heavy.' Deformed, 
underprivileged and argumentative, Ben actually became the most lovable group 
member: honest, direct and free of pretension. He brought humor and pathos to 
the stories, while his emotional responses and frequent tantrums suggested that 
he might really be the baby of the household. The others sported spiffy 
uniforms, he wore a big blue diaper. The perfect balance of this original family 
unit, with its staid parents, privileged older son and squalling, uninhibited 
infant, has made The Fantastic Four a uniquely appealing team.<BR><IMG

align=right> Over the years, the balance of the Fantastic Four has shifted on 
several occasions. More than one member has walked out in a huff, and even been 
apparently replaced, but with the passage of time, the status quo has always 
reasserted itself. The ties of blood and loyalty are as strong for misfits as 
they are for mortals. 
<P>
<H4><B>The 4</B></H4>
<P>"In creating The Fantastic four and the groundbreaking books that followed 
it, Lee and Kirby established that the personalities of the heroes, rather than 
the plots, should be of paramount importance. 'I was really interested in the 
characters as people,' Kirby says. 'I have a genuine feeling for real people and 
what I do is recreate them in a fantastic formula.' 
<P>'Characterization is the most important thing in any story,' says Lee. 'first 
I thought of the kind of character I wanted, then I figured out what kind of 
super power he'd have.' in a field where gimmicks were usually considered to be 
most important, the approach was revolutionary 
<P>The Fantastic Four acquired their amazing powers after their experimental 
rocket passed through a <U>storm of cosmic rays.</U> For their leader, Lee 
envisioned 'the worlds greatest scientist, who is also a little bit of a bore. 
He talks too much, he's too ponderous and he drives the others crazy.' this was 
Reed Richards, who took the name Mr. Fantastic after he acquired the somewhat 
absurd ability to stretch his body into any conceivable shape. there had been 
other "stretch" characters in comic books before-notably <B>Jack Cole's Plastic 
Man</B> from Quality Comics- and Timely had published a few tales about <B>Flexo 
the Rubber Man</B> in 1940. Yet the contrast between the flexibility gimmick and 
the rigid stuffiness of Richards made Mr. fantastic fresh and interesting. 
<P>'I thought we also had to have a girl,' continues Lee, 'but with a new twist: 
she's not just a girlfriend who doesn't know what the hero does.' (In fact, The 
Fantastic Four didn't bother with secret identities; all the other characters 
knew about their powers.) Sue Storm, a full fledged member for the team and 
Richards' fiancé, was able to transform herself into The Invisible Girl (later 
The Invisible Woman). She also learned to project a force field as a defensive 
weapon. 
<P>The third member of the group was Johnny Storm, Sue's kid brother. He was a 
teenager, but quite different from the stereotyped worshipful sidekick. Instead, 
Johnny was a show-off and a bit of a troublemaker; he used his powers to attract 
attention, and often displayed more interest in girls and fast cars than 
fighting the forces of evil. "I thought it was a shame that we didn't have The 
Human&nbsp;Torch anymore," says Lee, "and this was a good chance to bring him 
back." So Johnny Storm was given the name and the incendiary powers of the fiery 
hero Carl Burgos had created in 1939 for the original issue of Marvel 
Comics.</P>
<P>The individual in the group who represented the greatest degree of innovation 
also became the most popular - with his creators as well as with the fans. The 
cosmic rays turned Ben Grimm, a tough test pilot, into an ape-shaped, 
orange-skinned, craggy monster known as The Thing. Ben's tragic plight was 
dramatized by the occasion when he temporarily reverted to human form, but his 
belligerent sense of humor was his most endearing trait. "I wanted something 
really different," says Lee, "and I realized there was no monster, no funny, 
ugly guy who's a hero. All these characters have powers they like, but when this 
guy becomes very powerful, he also becomes grotesque. It had a touch of pathos." 
The Thing, who griped and bickered continuously, became the prototype for a 
number for Marvel's later heroes who were irritable roughnecks."</P><BR>
