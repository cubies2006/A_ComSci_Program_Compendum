        <p>.]] <i>Stan Lee</i> (born <i>Stanley Martin Lieber</i> on
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/December-28" target="_blank">
        December 28</a>,
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/1922" target="_blank">
        1922</a>) is an
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/United-States" target="_blank">
        American</a> writer and editor who, with several artists/co-creators, 
        especially
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Jack-Kirby" target="_blank">
        Jack Kirby</a> and
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Steve-Ditko" target="_blank">
        Steve Ditko</a>, introduced complex characters and a thoroughly shared 
        fictional universe into superhero comic books. His success helped change
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Marvel-Comics" target="_blank">
        Marvel Comics</a> from a small publishing house to a large multimedia 
        corporation. <br>
        <br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Early Career</h2>
        <p>In his teens, Lee began working for publisher Martin Goodman as a 
        copyboy at
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Timely-Comics" target="_blank">
        Timely Comics</a>, which would later become Marvel Comics. In
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/1941" target="_blank">
        1941</a>, a text filler page for a
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Captain-America" target="_blank">
        Captain America</a> comic book under the pen name <i>Stan Lee</i> was 
        his first published work. He soon graduated from filler to writing 
        actual comics, then became the youngest editor in the field at 17. <br>
        <br>
        During
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/World-War-II" target="_blank">
        World War II</a> Lee enlisted in the
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/United-States-Army" target="_blank">
        US army</a>, and served in the
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Signal-Corps" target="_blank">
        Signal Corps</a> writing manuals, training films, slogans, and 
        occasionally cartooning. His military classification was &quot;playwright&quot;; 
        only nine men in the US Army were awarded the title. <br>
        <br>
        After World War II, Lee returned to his position at what would become 
        Marvel Comics. At the time, many moral crusaders blamed comic books for 
        corrupting youth, a movement that was agitated by the rise of 
        horror-themed comic books. In response, comic book companies began 
        implementing strict internal regulations and eventually drew up the 
        stringent Comic Book Code. Also, at this time the superhero genre began 
        to decline and, by
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/1952" target="_blank">
        1952</a> only
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/DC-Comics" target="_blank">
        DC Comics</a>’
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Superman" target="_blank">
        Superman</a>,
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Batman" target="_blank">
        Batman</a> and
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Wonder-Woman" target="_blank">
        Wonder Woman</a> were published regularly. Because of these 
        circumstances, Lee wrote a number titles in a number of genres 
        throughout the
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/1950s" target="_blank">
        1950s</a>, but by the end of the decade had become dissatisfied with his 
        career and considered quitting the field. <br>
        <br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Marvel Revolution</h2>
        <p>In the late
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/1950s" target="_blank">
        1950s</a>, DC Comics revived the super hero genre and experienced a 
        significant sucess with the super team
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Justice-League-of-America" target="_blank">
        Justice League of America</a>. In responce, Martin Goodman, Marvel’s 
        publisher, assigned Lee to create a new superhero team. Lee’s wife urged 
        him to experiment with stories he preferred since the threat of getting 
        fired was meaningless. He acted on that advice, and suddenly, Lee's 
        career changed completely. <br>
        <br>
        The superhero group Lee and artist Jack Kirby produced was the superhero 
        family The
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Fantastic-Four" target="_blank">
        Fantastic Four</a>. Its immediate popularity led Lee and Marvel's 
        illustrators to produce a cavalcade of new titles. Lee created
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/The-Incredible-Hulk" target="_blank">
        The Incredible Hulk</a>,
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Iron-Man" target="_blank">
        Iron Man</a> and
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/The-Mighty-Thor" target="_blank">
        The Mighty Thor</a> and The
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/X-Men" target="_blank">
        X-Men</a> with Kirby;
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Daredevil" target="_blank">
        Daredevil</a> with Bill Everett; and
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Doctor-Strange" target="_blank">
        Doctor Strange</a> and Marvel's most successful character,
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Spider-Man" target="_blank">
        Spider-Man</a> with Steve Ditko. <br>
        <br>
        These characters helped reinvent the genre of the superhero comic. Lee 
        gave the superhero a flawed humanity. His heroes had bad tempers, 
        melancholy fits, vanity, greed, etc. They bickered amongst themselves, 
        worried about paying their bills and impressing girlfriends, and even 
        were sometimes physically ill. Lee wrote characters readers related to 
        rather than idealized. <br>
        <br>
        Throughout the
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/1960s" target="_blank">
        1960s</a>, Lee scripted and edited most of Marvel’s series, moderated 
        the letters pages, wrote a monthly column called “Stan’s Soapbox,” and 
        wrote endless promotional copy. To maintain his taxing workload yet 
        still meet deadlines, he developed what is known as the Marvel-style of 
        comic scripting. Aided by capable artists talented in storytelling, Lee 
        would first brainstorm or provide a brief synopsis of a story rather 
        than a full script. Based on the synopsis, an artist would then flesh it 
        out into the allotted number of pages. After the artist turned in 
        penciled pages, Lee would add dialogue and captions. In effect the 
        artists were co-writers, whose first drafts Lee built upon. <br>
        <br>
        Because of this system, the exact division of creative credits on Lee's 
        comics is still disputed, especially in the cases of comics drawn by 
        Kirby and Ditko. Some argue Lee hogged the credit for stories and 
        characters while shortchanging the artists. Others doubt this, including 
        Lee himself who has always effusively praised these artists; the 
        illusion may stem from out-of-context quotations by journalists, plus 
        Lee's bad memory and tendency to overpraise all co-workers equally. <br>
        <br>
        In
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/1971" target="_blank">
        1971</a>, Lee unintentionally reformed the Comics Code. The US 
        Department of Health asked Lee to write a story about the dangers of 
        drugs and Lee wrote a story in which Spider-Man’s best friend becomes 
        addicted to pills. The story was slated to be published in <i>Amazing 
        Spider-Man</i> #96 but the Comics Code Authority refused it because it 
        depicted drug use and the context in the story was considered 
        irrelevant. With his publisher's approval, Marvel published the comic 
        without the CCA seal of approval. The comic sold well and Marvel won 
        praise for having a social conscience. The CCA subsequently loosened the 
        code to permit negative depictions of drugs. <br>
        <br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Later Career</h2>
        <p>In later years, Lee became a figurehead and public face for Marvel 
        Comics. He made appearances at comic book conventions around the 
        country, lecturing and participating in panel discussions. He also moved 
        to California in
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/1981" target="_blank">
        1981</a> to develop Marvel's TV and movie properties. He has been an 
        executive producer for, and has made cameo appearances in, recent Marvel 
        film adaptations. He can be spotted as a hot dog vendor in <i>X-Men,</i> 
        as a festival salesman in <i>Spider-Man</i>, about to cross a street 
        with a newspaper in <i>Daredevil,</i> leaving a building in <i>Hulk</i>, 
        and as a pedestrian in <i>
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Spider-Man-2" target="_blank">
        Spider-Man 2</a></i>. <br>
        <br>
        Lee also made a cameo in
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Kevin-Smith" target="_blank">
        Kevin Smith</a>'s motion picture <i>
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Mallrats" target="_blank">
        Mallrats</a>,</i> recorded an interview with Smith as <i>Stan Lee's 
        Mutants, Monsters, and Marvels</i> and appeared as himself on <i>the 
        Simpsons</i>. He also voiced a character on the 2003 <i>Spider-Man</i> 
        animated series produced by
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/MTV" target="_blank">
        MTV</a>. <br>
        <br>
        During the dot-com boom, Lee lent his name and likeness to StanLee.Net, 
        an online multimedia company administered by others. It attempted to 
        blend internet animation with traditional comic strips, but 
        unfortunately the company became infamous for its mismanagement and 
        dubious accounting. <br>
        <br>
        In the
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/2000s" target="_blank">
        2000s</a>, Stan Lee did his first work for DC with the <i>Just 
        Imagine...</i> series, in which Lee reinvented several DC superheroes 
        including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Green-Lantern" target="_blank">
        Green Lantern</a> and
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/The-Flash" target="_blank">
        The Flash</a>. <br>
        <br>
        Lee created the risque animated superhero series <i>
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Stripperella" target="_blank">
        Stripperella</a></i> for
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Spike-TV" target="_blank">
        Spike TV</a>, and in 2004 announced plans to collaborate with
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Hugh-Hefner" target="_blank">
        Hugh Hefner</a> on a similar superhero cartoon featuring
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Playboy" target="_blank">
        Playboy</a> Playmates. <br>
        <br>
        In August
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/2004" target="_blank">
        2004</a>, Lee announced the launch of Stan Lee's Sunday Comics [<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2004/08/06/Arts/lee040806.html" target="_blank">http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2004/08/06/Arts/lee040806.html</a>], 
        to be hosted by Komicwerks.com, where monthly subscribers will be able 
        to read a new, updated comic every Sunday. As well, Stan's Soapbox will 
        be a weekly column run alongside the Sunday strip. <br>
        <br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Funky Flashman Parody</h2>
        <p>Jack Kirby, during his years of working for
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/DC-Comics" target="_blank">
        DC Comics</a> in the
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/1970s" target="_blank">
        1970s</a>, created the character Funky Flashman as a blatant parody of 
        Stan Lee. With his hyperbolic speech pattern, gaudy toupee, and hip 70s 
        Manhattan style beard (a style Lee was said to sport at the time) this 
        ne'er-do-well charlatan first appeared in the pages of <i>
        <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Mister-Miracle" target="_blank">
        Mister Miracle</a></i>. <br>
