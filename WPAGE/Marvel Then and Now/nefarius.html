<P align="justify"><img border="0" src="nefarius1.jpg" align="left" width="293" height="275"><font face="Verdana">Nefarius was originally Lloyd Bloch. Lloyd Bloch used to go 
by the name of Moonstone. He was the original posessor of the Moonstone now 
possessed by Karla Sofen. When Karla took the stone she left Lloyd a complete 
psychotic. After he regained his sanity he found one of his fellow patients had 
found a way to recreate the process that gave Count Nefaria his immense power. 
Since then Lloyd has spent all of his time trying to get revenge on Karla for 
her abuse of him.</font></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2 face="Verdana">Captain America #170- flashback- Lloyd breaks into a 
small midwestern university in order to steal some moon rocks for a European 
collector. He picks up a blue rock and it starts to glow. Security arrives. 
Frustrated he throws his bag of tools at them. He sees that he seriously injured 
one of them. He figures he has to get away now to avoid a potential murder 
charge. The other guard shoots and hits the Moonstone. The stone merges with his 
fist, and his fist starts to disappear. The guard is stunned. Lloyd goes to 
swing at the guard, but a blast escapes from his hand. Lloyd thinks that it must 
be something about him that caused this to happen since dozens of other people 
must have touched the rock before him. Later Lloyd figures that if he designed 
some armor he could make a fortune now. He dons his costume and names himself 
Moonstone. Moonstone goes to Haderman and the Viper to join up with them. 
Haderman wants Moonstone to lay low. Haderman starts an ad campaign to discredit 
Captain America. </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal align="justify"><FONT size=2 face="Verdana">Captain America #169- Moonstone’s partner 
Quentin Haderman has started a smear campaign against Captain America. He 
questions Captain America’s ethics, why he is on the outs with SHIELD, why he is 
dressed in the flag when no agency takes responsibility for his actions. When 
Cap confronts Haderman, Quentin sets him up by staging a crime outside. Tumbler 
gets away from Cap. Later Cap sees Haderman with a man named Keane. Cap 
recognizes Keane as Tumbler’s secret identity. Cap attacks. From a secret sniper 
spot Moonstone uses a sliver thin laser beam to shoot Keane through the skull. 
Keane drops dead and it looks like Captain America killed him during their 
fight.</FONT></P>

<img border="0" src="nefarius2.jpg" align="right" width="259" height="391">Captain America runs from the police. He thinks to himself that as a 
believer in due process he has to turn himself in, but he never gets the chance 
as he is hit from behind by Moonstone. Moonstone says that he is going to 
replace Captain America and restore honor where he has left disgrace. Captain 
America says that it sounds like Moonstone is reading from Haderman’s book. Cap 
and Moonstone clash. Moonstone hits Cap and he goes flying. Cap uses his shield 
to cushion his landing. Moonstone is quickly upon Cap, and Cap has to quickly 
move his shield to block Moonstone’s punch. Cap hits Moonstone and is stunned 
when Moonstone isn’t knocked out. Cap leaps at Moonstone, but Moonstone vanishes 
and reappears behind him. Moonstone says that he is tired of toying with Cap. He 
hits Cap with an energy blast from his hand. Cap is knocked out. Haderman comes 
along and says that by right of American competition they have a new 
defender…Moonstone. The crowd cheers. Later Cap wakes up in jail as the 
reporters talk to Moonstone. They ask what his background is, and how he got his 
powers. Moonstone tells them he was a janitor at a University when he touched a 
blue moon rock and gained his power. He names himself Moonstone, and joins up 
with his committee to battle everything evil. Haderman and Moonstone leave Cap 
in jail and go. Later a group of Cap supporters break down the wall to the 
prison.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal align="justify"><FONT size=2 face="Verdana">Captain America #171- Cap tries to decline the 
offer, but when the guards show he has to fight his would be liberators to stop 
them from killing the police. The Sanitation Unit gasses them all and takes Cap 
with them. Cap wakes before they know and discovers that the Sanitation Unit is 
just another attempt by Haderman to make him look bad. Cap gets away. Later the 
Falcon has returned from Wakanda with new wings that allow him to “glide”. 
Falcon finds Cap and Cap tells him all about how he was set up. Falcon says that 
he will help Cap. Suddenly Moonstone speaks up and tells Falcon that he just 
taped what he said to prove to America that he is Cap’s criminal accomplice. Cap 
tells Moonstone to admit that he and Haderman are just setting him up. Moonstone 
says that the recorder is off so why not. He even admits that he was the one who 
killed Tumbler. Cap asks why Moonstone is doing this. Moonstone says the answer 
is easy…money and power coupled with the enjoyment of watching Cap destroyed. 
Falcon leaps up and starts to “glide” towards Moonstone. Moonstone flies up and 
blasts Falcon with a hand blast. Falcon is knocked out and spiraling to the 
ground. Cap catches him, but because he is distracted Moonstone flies up behind 
him and grabs Cap’s shoulders. Moonstone blasts Cap, and then stands over the 
unconscious bodies of Falcon and Captain America. </FONT></P>
<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><FONT size=2>Captain America #172- Moonstone is just about to kill Captain 
America and Falcon when Quent stops him. Quent says that no matter how well the 
smear campaign has worked that killing Cap and Falcon would make them martyrs. 
He tells Moonstone to take the capture to the media who are already favoring 
them. Moonstone leaves Cap and Falcon with the “Sanitation Squad” for them to 
guard them while he goes and calls the media. Cap and Falcon wake up before he 
returns and as Moonstone walks back Cap and Falcon knock him over. Cap says that 
sorry he can’t stay but he can’t risk Moonstone defeating them again before he 
can prove his innocence. Moonstone watches them run off because he doesn’t want 
to risk losing in public. Moonstone yells at the Sanitation Squad, but then 
tells them that they better hit him in the back of the head so he will have 
proof when he tells the reporters he just called that Cap hit him in the back of 
the head.</FONT> </font> </P>
<P class=MsoNormal align="justify"><FONT size=2 face="Verdana">Captain America #174- Captain America and Falcon 
have learned from the X-Men that their true common enemy has been the Secret 
Empire. They disguise themselves and help to steal the Electron-Gyro from the

Cap leaves a note explaining, not realizing that the head of the Brand 
Corporation also belongs to the Secret Empire. Captain America, Falcon, 
Professor X, Marvel Girl, and Cyclops fight against the Secret Empire. Elsewhere 
Moonstone appears on a morning talk show. The interviewer asks how it feels to 
be America’s newest idol. Moonstone says that it is tough living with danger, 
but when he thinks about how his first arrest was the fallen idol Captain 
America he says it makes it all worthwhile. Another guest, the blond sexy Miss 
Kearny, flirts with Moonstone. Moonstone says that with Captain America and 
Watergate he is happy to do his part to hold together this great nation. Cap and 
the others find the mutants Lorna Dane, Havok, Mesmero, Angel, Iceman, Beast, 
Mastermind, Unus, and Blob all hooked up to some “hideous machine”. They get 
them off, but Cap, Falc, Prof. X, Jean, and Cyclops are killed when the Secret 
Empire shoots them with the “Atomic Annihilator”.</FONT></P>
<P align="justify"><FONT size=2 face="Verdana">Captain America #175- Cap, Falcon, and the X-Men have been

out of a congressional hearing. Quent says that it al went smoothly. As they 
gloat about how they manipulated the truth to make Moonstone a hero they 
suddenly see that their allies, the Secret Empire, are attacking the White 
House. The Secret Empire has a weapon/ship powered by the captured mutants. 
Number One (the leader) says that they are powerless to stop them. Moonstone 
flies over as a hero to “oppose” the Secret Empire. Number One sends out his 
marshall of the warrior squad, Number Two. Moonstone takes a dive and is taken 
captive by the Secret Empire. Inside the ship Moonstone and Number Two 
congratulate each other on their performances. Moonstone walks out of the ship 
and tells everyone how hopeless the fight is. Number One says that the 
Sanitation Squad is planting nuclear devices and that if America doesn’t 
surrender that he will order the destruction of every major city. Suddenly Cap, 
Falcon, Cyclops, and Jean Grey rise to oppose the Secret Empire. Falcon rushes 
off to tell SHIELD the bomb locations. Moonstone sees Cap and says that he sees 
Cap has come to join his Secret Empire friends. Cap says that is the last lie 
that he will tell about him. Cap plows into Moonstone. Moonstone blasts Cap, but 
hits his shield. Cap throws the shield into Moonstone’s face. Cap beats 
Moonstone down. Harderman tries to say that he was duped, but Moonstone

<img border="0" src="nefarius3.jpg" align="left" width="256" height="389">Captain America #379- Captain America and Quasar are called during their 
jog for an Avengers priority at the city courthouse. Two people have been 
killed, but no description of the villain. As they arrive Nefarius smashes 
through the courthouse wall with Moonstone under an arm. Karla is wearing 
manacles and boots that prevent her from using her powers. Cap recognizes the 
outfit as belonging to Count Nefaria. Cap and Quasar get closer to try and 
negotiate with their unknown opponent. Nefarius instantly recognizes Captain 
America. Cap asks if he knows him. Nefarius says that he doesn’t anymore. 
Nefarius shoots eye blasts. Cap blocks the beams, but almost hits Moonstone with 
the ricochet. Nefarius says that if anyone gets to hurt her it will be him. 
Nefarius leaps away, and warns Cap that he will kill her if he follows. 
Moonstone asks Nefarius where he is taking her. Nefarius says he will tell her 
when they get there. He also tells her to shut up and enjoy the ride. As 
Nefarius leaps off the top of a building pieces of rubble fall. Quasar catches 
the rubble with an energy construct. As they chase after them Captain remembers 
the face and name of Nefarius. He remembers his name Lloyd Bloch, and that he 
once fought him when he was the old Moonstone. Nefarius lands near a church. He 
goes inside to hide from Captain America and Quasar he says until he is done 
with Moonstone. Moonstone asks what Lloyd wants from her. Nefarius says that he 
wants to kill her for when she took advantage of him. Lloyd tells her how he was 
institutionalized after she stole his Moonstone, and how he got his new power. 
He says that he has the power to do whatever he wants, and what he wants is to 
kill Karla. Karla asks if he is going to kill her there in the church. Nefarius 
says that funeral services are held there all the time. Karla apologizes to 
Nefarius for hurting him, and that she has been racked with guilt since. She 
explains that she saw his power and coveted it. She says that the power blinded 
her to the man behind the power. Karla tries to come on to him, but Nefarius 
says to forget it. He tells her to pick the first bone he will break. Karla says 
that Nefarius is obsessed with her not out of hate, but out of love. She says 
that he has been fantasizing about her that whole time. She asks why kill her 
when he can posses her utterly. She says that she wants him to possess her, and 
that she has been looking for a virile enough man to dominate her. She asks that 
they love each other as only superior beings can. She asks Nefarius to release 
her manacles so that she can caress and make him feel like nobody ever has. 
Nefarius uses his eye blasts to destroy the manacles. Just as her arms are free 
Cap shows up and grabs Moonstone. Quasar buts a bubble around Nefarius’ head to 
stop his eye blasts, and holds him with a band around his body. Nefarius leaps 
through the ceiling of the church with Quasar in tow. Quasar forms a bubble all 
the way around Nefarius. Nefarius is thrashing about inside. Quasar tries to 
reel the bubble in, but brings it too close and Nefarius knocks him out through 
the bubble. Nefarius holds Quasar as he drops to the ground. Cap throws his 
shield, but Nefarius catches it in his teeth. He throws Quasar at Cap, and grabs 
the unconscious Moonstone. As he walks away Moonstone wakes up and blasts him 
between the ears. Nefarius falls on her. Quasar wakes up and transports both 
Nefarius and Moonstone to the Vault.</FONT></P>

into another room. Nefarius shatters his restraints. He starts destroying the

to Nefarius, but he says he isn't a fool and throws her into the wall of her
