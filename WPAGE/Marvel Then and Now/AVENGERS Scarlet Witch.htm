      <P class=normal>Affiliation: <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/avengers.asp">Avengers</A><BR>Previous 
      Affiliations: Avengers West Coast, Force Works, the Brotherhood of Evil 
      Mutants (1st incarnation)
      <P>Known Relatives: Pietro Maximoff (brother) [(also known as 
      Quicksilver)], Magnus (father) [(also known as Eric Lensherr/ <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/magneto.asp">Magneto</A>)], Magda (mother, 
      deceased), Django Maximoff (adoptive father, deceased), Marya Maximoff 
      (adoptive mother, deceased), Vision (ex-husband)
      <P>Wanda's mutant abilites were primarily energy based, until she was 
      exposed to the chaos magic of Chloton as a mere baby. It was then that her 
      powers became based on altering probablities. The Scarlet Witch can stop 
      arrows in midflight, cause guns to jam, etc... If it seems impossible, the 
      Scarlet Witch's hex powers can make it possible. At one time, Immortus 
      increased Wanda's powers so that she recreated reality with her hexes (one 
      example was when she used her hex powers to prevent Simon William's 
      death). She lost the power increase, as well as her powers for a time, but 
      after rejoining the Avengers in the wake of the return of the heroes. 
      Morgan LeFay instilled her magicks into Wanda so that she could alter 
      reality to her needs. Wanda broke free and has since gained a great 
      mastery of her powers. When before she could only hope the effects would 
      happen as planned, Wanda can now control the outcome.
      <P>Wanda Maximoff was the daughter of the mutant called Magnus and a gypsy 
      woman named Magda. Just prior to her birth, her mother fled from her 
      father, terrified of the bizarre powers he suddenly manifested. Seeking 
      refuge in the scientific citadel of Wundagore in the Balkan mountains of 
      the tiny nation of Transia, Magda was taken in by Bova, a woman evolved 
      from a cow by the master of genetic acceleration, the High Evolutionary. 
      Magda gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, with Bova as her midwife. 
      Still afraid that her husband might find her and learn of the children, 
      Magda left Bova a note explaining her fears, and walked into the frozen 
      mountain wilderness to perish. Feeling that it was not right to raise two 
      seemingly normal babies in the environment of the evolved animal-men of 
      Wundagore, Bova was relieved when several nights later, an American couple 
      vacationing in Europe, Robert and Madeline Frank, also came to Wundagore 
      seeking natal assistance. Bova intended to award the couple the days-old 
      twins to raise along with their own newborn. Unfortunately, the couple's 
      child was stillborn and Madeline died from complications in childbirth. 
      Bova presented Robert Frank with the twins, representing them as his own 
      natural children, in the hope it would assuage his grief. Years later, 
      Frank and the children would believe that he was their natural father. 
      Bova then presented the twins to her master, the High Evolutionary, who 
      agreed to find human foster parents for them.
      <P>The High Evolutionary did find such parents for them in the persons of 
      Django and Marya Maximoff, a gypsy couple camped nearby who had lost their 
      own two children, Ana and Mateo, during World War II. The Maximoffs 
      accepted the strange gifts from the High Evolutionary and were told their 
      names were Wanda and Pietro, the names their natural mother had given them 
      at birth. The Maximoffs cared for the children as if they were their own. 
      Years later, Django would believe that Wanda and Pietro were his natural 
      children Ana and Mateo. As adolescents, Wanda and Pietro discovered that 
      they had peculiar talents. With a particular gesture while she was in a 
      certain frame of mind, Wanda found that she could cause unusual phenomena 
      to occur. When Django began to steal food to feed his starving family, 
      enraged villagers attacked the gypsy camp. Using his phenomenal speed, 
      Pietro fled from the camp with his sister. The traumatic circumstances of 
      the separation from their family were so severe that not until well into 
      adulthood could they remember anything but the barest details of their 
      childhood. The next few years, Wanda and Pietro wandered central Europe, 
      living off the land.
      <P>One day, Wanda accidentally caused a house to burst into flames with 
      her uncontrollable hex powers, and was chased by superstitious 
      townspeople. Despite Pietro's attempt to defend her, they were soon 
      overpowered and about to become victims of mob violence when Magneto came 
      to their rescue. Unaware that he was their natural father, <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/magneto.asp">Magneto</A> pressed them into 
      service in his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, costumed them, and named them 
      the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. For months they served <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/magneto.asp">Magneto</A> out of a sense of 
      obligation and fear of his reprisal. When the extraterrestrial Stranger 
      transported <A href="http://www.cocs.com/magneto.asp">Magneto</A> from 
      Earth, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver left the Brotherhood and 
      petitioned for membership in the <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/avengers.asp">Avengers</A>. They were inducted 
      along with Hawkeye to take the place of the charter members, who wished a 
      leave of absence.
      <P>At one point during her career as an <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/avengers.asp">Avenger</A>, the Scarlet Witch 
      underwent training in sorcery under the tutelage of a true witch named 
      Agatha Harkness. The mental discipline of sorcery aided the Scarlet 
      Witch's powers of concentration, enabling her to exercise much greater 
      control over her mutant hexes than ever before. While an active member of 
      the <A href="http://www.cocs.com/avengers.asp">Avengers</A>, the Scarlet 
      Witch met, became romantically involved with, and married the synthetic 
      man called the Vision. For a few years after their marriage, the two lived 
      in Avengers Mansion, saving their Avengers' salaries. Eventually, the 
      couple bought a house in Leonia, New Jersey, and retired from active 
      membership. They returned to active duty when the Baxter Building was 
      threatened by Annihilus' null-field. The Vision assumed chairmanship when 
      most of the <A href="http://www.cocs.com/avengers.asp">Avengers</A> 
      disappeared while fighting the first Secret War. After a several week 
      stint, the Vision stepped down as leader and the couple returned to 
      Leonia. By warping probabilities, Wanda managed to be impregnated by the 
      artificial Vision. The twin sons, William and Thomas, were the apple of 
      Wanda's eye. However, she did not realize the sinister nature of the 
      twins. These children were not real flesh and blood. They were, in fact, 
      shards of the demon Mephisto's soul. When she was not conciously thinking 
      about her babies, they would not exist. During a battle with Master 
      Pandemonium, the Avengers West Coast discovered this truth and to prevent 
      Mephisto from destroying the <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/avengers">Avengers</A>, Agatha Harkness went 
      into Wanda's mind and blocked out the memory of the twins from her mind.
      <P>This caused Mephisto to explode and dissipate and put Wanda in a coma. 
      <A href="http://www.cocs.com/magneto.asp">Magneto</A> soon came to his 
      daughter and brought her to the dark side of life. Empowered by Immortus 
      and tainted by Magneto, Wanda was a force to reckon with. She soon 
      regained her mind and rejoined the Avengers. She remained with them until 
      the West Coast branch was disbanded. <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/ironman.asp">Iron Man</A> then started Force 
      Works, and Wanda joined that as team leader. During the Crossing (an 
      abomination of an Avengers tale), the Scarlet Witch returned to the <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/avengers.asp">Avengers</A>, but soon disappeared 
      as a result of <A href="http://www.cocs.com/onslaught.asp">Onslaught</A>. 
      A year later after her disappearance, Wanda returned to the Avengers. She 
      found that she could resurrect her dead teammate, Wonder Man, whenever she 
      was in a time of need. Wanda also started learning of new aspects of her 
      powers, including the ability to manipulate energies (mental, physical, 
      etc...)
      <P>Current Situation: The Vision and the Scarlet Witch have since 
      "divorced" and Wanda has started a relationship with the newly restored 
      Wonder Man. During a time when <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/captainamerica.asp">Captain America</A> and <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/ironman.asp">Iron Man</A> were on leave of 
      absense, Wanda was selected as the deputy leader of the <A 
      href="http://www.cocs.com/avengers.asp">Avengers</A>. She is now 
      responsible for the morale of the team, as well as other non-combat 
      procedures. Wanda's control over her powers has increased incredibly, 
      which is partially how she was able to defeat Alkhema, a creation of 
      Ultron based on the deceased Avenger, Mockingbird.
