                <font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>History:</strong>Ben 
                was born and raised in the poverty stricken part of New York on 
                the street known as Yancy Street. His father, who was a 
                alcoholic, was unable to keep a job. Ben's older brother 
                supported the family for the most part through the illegal money 
                from the Yancy Street gang. When Ben was 8, his older brother 
                was killed in a violent gang war. Within 10 years, Ben, 
                idolizing his brother, became leader of the gang. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the death of his parents, Ben moved in with his 
                uncle Jake who brought Ben out of poverty and into a decent 
                home. In Ben's senior year of High School, Ben received a 
                Football scholarship to Empire State University. There he met 
                Reed Richards where Reed asked him to test fly his ship once it 
                was built. Ben jokingly agreed and the two went their separate 
                ways after college. Ben became a test pilot with the Air Force.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ben met up with Reed again years latter where Reed was 
                preparing to launch the ship with Ben as the pilot. Although Ben 
                argued how the ship wasn't ready, the two along with Susan and 
                Johnny Storm launched into space. Due to a high amount of 
                radiation in the Van Allen Belt, the four where bombarded with 
                Cosmic Rays. As the team blacked out, Reed was able to hit the 
                auto pilot and the ship crash landed on Earth. There Ben mutated 
                into the hero that Susan dubbed the Thing. At first the Thing's 
                skin was smooth and lumpy. As the years passed though, he formed 
                a rocky appearance. His strength level changed as well. While he 
                could only bench 5 tons at first, his strength has vastly 
                multiplied due to the continuous absorption of Cosmic Rays.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ben learned to accept his change due mostly to his 
                ex-girlfriend, Alicia Masters. During his stay on the Secret 
                Wars Planet, Alicia was kidnapped and replaced with an alien 
                Skrull (see Lyra).&nbsp; The impostor Alicia married Johnny and 
                nearly carried his child. Ben quit the team all together, 
                returning finally and taking Reed's place as leader. There he 
                fell in love with an old friend, Sharon Ventura, the second Ms. 
                Marvel. After&nbsp;she was exposed to cosmic rays and transformed 
                into a&nbsp;Thing, Ben and Sharon fell in love. It wasn't to last 
                though for during a freak accident, Ben was turned&nbsp;human, which 
                made Sharon feel alienated. To save their relationship,&nbsp;Ben 
                turned himself back into the Thing, while Dr. Doom transformed 
                Sharon back to human form. Shortly there after, Alicia was 
                revealed to be a Skrull imposer, and the true Alicia was 
                recovered, still in love with Ben.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ben, feeling betrayed by this since he still believed with 
                his heart that Johnny married Alicia, Ben couldn't return to 
                her. Sharon then returned, an agent of Dr.Doom and allied 
                herself with the team. During a battle with Wolverine, the 
                Thing's face was slashed horribly. Due to Sharon's love for Ben, 
                she betrayed Dr. Doom, which Dr. Doom then transformed her human 
                form into a Hulk like monster. She was contained in the team's 
                headquarters and then released, only to vanish after a battle 
                with the team. The son of Ben's godson, Franklin, restored his 
                face to normal and the team was thrown into another dimension 
                during the battle with the mutant menace known as Onslaught. 
                There they lived out their earlier days of the team. After a 
                year, the team was returned to normal space with a number of 
                other heroes.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the destruction of their old base, the team took 
                up base in Pier Four. There Ben learned that Alicia had fallen 
                in love with the Silver Surfer, which didn't last long at all. 
                Due to a recent battle with the Grey Gargoyle, the Thing was 
                transformed into stone. Due to the chemical mix of Diablo's 
                potions that Ben was exposed to and the mutagenic effects of the 
                Grey Gargoyle's powers, Ben can now transform into his human 
                form. Since nearly every transformation has been followed by 
                certain side effects, it remains unclear on what the outcome may 
                be of Ben's current situation.</font></td>
