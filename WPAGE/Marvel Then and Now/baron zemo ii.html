Zemo, the thirteenth Zemo, is a man born to a legacy of evil. His father 
Heinrich Zemo was one of the most brilliant scientists working for the Nazis in 
World War II. Heinrich managed to accidentally kill himself in a fight with 
Captain America, but even before then Zemo blamed Captain America for all his 
life's problems. Recently Zemo has come to realize that Cap needn't be the focal 
point of his life, and has decided to give world domination a try. </font> </P>
