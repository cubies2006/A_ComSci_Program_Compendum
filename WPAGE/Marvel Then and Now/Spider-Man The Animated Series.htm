      size=2>For over 30 years, Spider-Man has been the world's most popular 
      superhero, wielding his amazing spider-powers and web-slinging weaponry in 
      breathtaking battles with fearsome, larger-than-life foes like Venom, The 
      Lizard, and Scorpion. As created by Stan Lee, The Amazing Spider-Man was 
      the first comic book to present the Superhero as Everyman.
      <P>This series asks what would really happen if an ordinary guy got 
      super-powers? The ordinary guy is Peter Parker, a nineteen-year-old 
      student from Forest Hills, New York. And despite his ability to crawl 
      straight up walls with the strength, speed, and agility of a spider, he 
      still can't remember when he makes a date with Mary Jane or keep from 
      catching the common cold. Even with his near-clairvoyant spider-sense, he 
      can't find his socks and misplaces his camera.
      <P>Spider-Man is coming-of-age story of Peter Parker who is learning that 
      true heroism lies less in deeds of valor than in the simple act of getting 
      through the day without compromising his principles or hurting his loved 
      ones. </FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
