was once known as "Crusher" Creel public enemy...proven murderer...escaped 
convict." Creel's position has soften a little over the years (he even went 
straight for a bit), and as with all Marvel muscle the longer he is around the 
less serious he's taken. Creel has defeated Thor numerous times, and physically 
beaten the Hulk. Coupled with Titania, his wife, the two are a force to be 
reckoned with.</font></P>
