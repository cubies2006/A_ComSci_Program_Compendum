            src="The Marvel Family Web  Who's Who  Captain Marvel_files/whizcomics002_01.jpg" 
            width=311 align=right> Alone and on the streets of a major 
            metropolitan city, orphaned newsboy <B>Billy Batson</B> was led into 
            an abandoned subway tunnel by a <B>mysterious stranger</B>. On an 
            out-of-service rail-track an odd and driverless subway car stopped 
            to pick-up Billy and his companion. Following a brief trip, Billy 
            and the stranger disembarked the train and walked down a ancient 
            hallway. On one side of the cavernous hall grotesque statues of the 
            <B>Seven Deadly Enemies of Man</B>: Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, 
            Selfishness, Laziness and Injustice loomed. </P>
            <P><IMG height=255 alt="The first appearance of Captain Marvel." 
            src="The Marvel Family Web  Who's Who  Captain Marvel_files/whizComics002_02.jpg" 
            width=169 align=left> As mysteriously as he appeared the stranger 
            vanishes. Sitting on a throne at the far-end of the hall is a 
            wizened old man with long white hair and a full, almost floor-length 
            white beard. At the old man’s beckoning, Billy steps forward and 
            stops in front of the throne. </P>
            <P>The old man announces himself by proclaiming, "I am <A 
            href="http://shazam.imginc.com/WhosWho/shazam.asp">Shazam</A>!," 
            amid a peal of thunder and flash of lightning. As the smoke clears 
            Billy notices the wall behind the wizard is inscribed with the names 
            of six great elders which together form the name <B>SHAZAM</B>: 
            <B>S</B>olomon- wisdom, <B>H</B>ercules - strength, <B>A</B>tlas - 
            stamina, <B>Z</B>eus - power, <B>A</B>chilles - Courage, and 
            <B>M</B>ercury - speed. Shazam relates to the young boy that he 
            needs a new champion to battle evil and that he has chosen Billy. 
            "Speak my name" shouts Shazam! </P>
            <P>As Billy shouts the name of the ancient wizard, lightning drops 
            from the ceiling of the chamber striking him, while at the same time 
            a deafening peal of thunder echoes off the cavern walls. As the 
            smoke clears, Billy discovers that he has been transformed into a 
            man! </P>
            <P>"Captain Marvel, I salute you," says Shazam! At that moment a 
            slab of stone hanging above Shazam’s head, held in place by a 
            tattered thread, crashes down onto the old wizard crushing him. From 
            the dust and rumble a ghostly image of Shazam appears and lights a 
            nearby brazier. </P>
            <P>At that, Captain Marvel sets off to track down the evil radio 
            silencer plaguing his fair city — and at that Captain Marvel meets 
            his arch-nemesis for the first time: <A 
            href="http://shazam.imginc.com/WhosWho/drsivana.asp">Dr. Thaddeus 
            Bodog Sivana</A>! </P>
            <P>For the next thirteen years, Captain Marvel became one of the 
            most popular and beloved characters in all superhero-dom. 
            Mysteriously as he began, Captain Marvel disappeared from site in 
            1953. </P><IMG height=50 alt=History 
            src="The Marvel Family Web  Who's Who  Captain Marvel_files/history.gif" 
            width=250> 
            <P>After a 20 year hiatus, it was revealed that in his attempt to 
            place Captain Marvel in suspended animation, Sivana also caught 
            himself, the rest of the Sivana Family as well most of Captain 
            Marvel's friends and family in the same trap. </P>
            <H2>Earth-S</H2>
            <P>Sivana used a compound of his own invention, called Suspendium, 
            to pull off his nefarious feat. He transported the Cap and the other 
            folks to space where he placed them in the Suspendium globe. 
            Sivana's son, Sivana Jr., accidently caused Sivana's space ship to 
            crash into the globe trapping themselves as well. </P>
            <P><IMG height=330 
            alt="Captain Marvel returns after a 20 year hiatus." 
            src="The Marvel Family Web  Who's Who  Captain Marvel_files/shazam001_01.jpg" 
            width=182 align=right> After 20 years, the Suspendium globe moved 
            close enough to the sun and started to melt. Captain Marvel was the 
            first to awaken and he freed the rest of Sivana's prisoners. In the 
            end, Cap captured the Sivana's and sent them back to jail. </P>
            <P>It was during this time that it was revealed that the Marvels 
            lived on Earth-S, a parallel world existing in a different vibratory 
            space from the DC Universes of Earth-1 and Earth-2. Earth-1 and 
            Earth-2 were homes to the silver and golden age DC heroes including 
            Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and the rest. It was only inevitable 
            that the greatest heroes of their respective earths should meet in 
            battle. </P>
            <P>Cap first fought Superman during one of the Justice League's 
            annual cross-overs with the Justice Society. The adventure also 
            reintroduced many of the old Fawcett heroes including <A

            <A href="http://shazam.imginc.com/WhosWho/ibis.asp">Ibis</A>, <A

            Although the battle was short-lived, <IMG height=330 
            alt="Captain Marvel and Superman." 
            src="The Marvel Family Web  Who's Who  Captain Marvel_files/cap_supes.jpg" 
            width=300 align=left> a major confrontation occurred nearly a year 
            later and featured not only Cap and Superman visiting each other's 
            earths but also the first meeting between Mary Marvel and Supergirl. 
            </P>
            <P>Cap had many adventures both solo and with Mary Marvel and 
            Captain Marvel Junior. Many of Cap's former foes seemed to also have 
            been trapped in the Suspendium. Captain Marvel was besieged by the 
            likes of <A href="http://shazam.imginc.com/WhosWho/mrmind.asp">Mr.

            <P>Cap even traveled back in time to and shared an adventure with 
            the Golden-Age All-Star Squadron - this time battling the Earth-2 
            Superman! </P>
            <P>Shortly thereafter, a cataclysmic, universal catastrophe called 
            the Crisis on Infinite Earths occurred. Cap joined the heroes from 
            many earths to battle the evil Anti-Monitor - a being hellbent on 
            destroying all the parallel universes and restarting the universe 
            from scratch. Cap and the other heroes defeated the Anti-Monitor but 
            not before the remaining earths were merged together. For the first 
            time, Cap and his family lived on the same earth as Superman and 
            Batman. But this union was not without its problems. </P>
            <H2>Post-Crisis</H2>
            <P>Cap's origin and adventures seemed to be plotted by a mysterious 
            hand that kept erasing and readjusting Cap's history. At one point, 
            Captain Marvel lived in San Francisco with his real <A 
            href="http://shazam.imginc.com/WhosWho/uncledudley.asp">Uncle 
            Dudley</A> and real uncle Sivana. </P>
            <H2>The Past Four Years</H2>
            <P>Billy Batson was permanently relocated to Fawcett City where he 
            rents his own apartment. He works at Radio Station W.H.I.Z. as Billy 
            and on the docks as a disguised Captain Marvel. </P>
            <P>Billy eventually found his long lost sister Mary. Mary discovered 
            that she too could turn into <A 
            href="http://shazam.imginc.com/WhosWho/marymarvel.asp">Captain 
            Marvel</A> by saying the magic word, Shazam! When Billy and Mary are 
            both Captain Marvel their respective powers are reduced by half. 
</P>
            <P>Billy and Mary's foster parent's hometown of Fairfield was 
            leveled by the malevolent robot, <A 
            href="http://shazam.imginc.com/WhosWho/mratom.asp">Mr. Atom</A> -- a 
            pawn of that wicked worm, Mr. Mind. Luckily for both Billy and Mary, 
            their parents were away at the time. </P>
            <P>Captain Marvel fought Superman, once again and Billy ended up 
            coming to terms with Black Adam. Both Captain Marvel and Black Adam 
            are members of the JSA (Justice Society of America). </P><IMG
