<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>History: Morg became Galactus’s herald, when Galactus became 
dissatisfied with his current herald, Nova’s, performance. Nova had too much 
compassion and mercy for life and spared a planet Galactus could have feasted 
on. So, Galactus sought after a new herald, who was more ruthless. He found Morg 
when he came to Morg’s planet, to devour it. Morg said he did not care about his 
fellow citizens, but for his own life. Galactus spared him and made him into his 
herald, then devoured his planet. Morg then became Galactus’s herald, through 
the Surfer had strong disapproval. Morg eventually found a planet for Galactus, 
which had a special power source called the Waters of Life. Morg absorbed the 
Waters of Life and became even more powerful. Silver Surfer considered this to 
be a threat and assembled the other former heralds. They banned together to 
fight Morg, but were not powerful enough. If it wasn’t for Galactus intervening 
they would have surely lost. Galactus agreed that Morg had too much power and 
took the Power Cosmic away from him. With just the power he absorbed from the 
Waters of Life, Morg was easily defeated by the heralds and killed by Terrax, 
but not after he killed Nova. </FONT></b></P>
