    The summer kicks off with the sequel of one of the long-awaited comic book 
    adaptations in recent history. While the first X-Men managed to amaze avid 
    fans and average moviegoers alike, it didn't quite meet my expectations. 
    However, &quot;X-Men United&quot; definitely delivers, packing double the action and 
    double the special effects. Being the geek that I am, they might as well 
    have titled it 2X.
    <p>I don't really trust trailers that much; they're created to manipulate 
    watchers for pure marketing goals. From the first impression of the X-2 
    trailer, it seemed like Hollywood traded the plot for meaningless fight 
    scenes and hot girls in uniform. However, after seeing the movie, it became 
    all clear; the plot is still there and the fight scenes are meaningful. Oh 
    yeah, and the hot girls in uniform are there, too. *grin* </p>
    <p>Yeah… we have more cool characters, awesome action sequences, dazzling 
    special effects (although a bit too shiny at times) and, finally, a pretty 
    good storyline. The first &quot;X-Men,&quot; building the foundation for the series, 
    was sort of bland. This one was definitely more exciting, especially with 
    the thought of X-Men uniting to clean up some fucked up human filth! Oops… 
    However, I was disappointed with Mystique. No, she does have some good 
    moves, but her character just isn't as dark as before. She's no longer… a 
    mystique. </p>
    <p>The story goes like this: A military scientist seeking vengeance for his 
    son's death devises ways to control the mutant's minds, to sway them for his 
    own evil purposes; mainly, to rid the world of the mutant presence. The 
    mutants, good and bad, unite to face this mortal threat. The story builds up 
    to the very sad but hopeful ending. </p>
    <p>Yes, there is a hint somewhere close to the end. It seems we're looking 
    at yet another X-Men movie. With many comic-based movies out there, from 
    Spider-man to The Hulk, it looks like the real war is about to take place… 
    on-screen and off it. Anyway, if the next X-Men installment is, at the 
    least, as good as this one, I'm there. </p>
