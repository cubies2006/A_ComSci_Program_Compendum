<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Vision and Scarlet Witch vol. 2 #1- Black 
Talon’s zombies return with an unconscious Scarlet Witch. The zombie is mumbling 
something so Nekra asks Black Talon what they are saying. Black Talon says that 
even he didn’t understand that one. Nekra walks out to start looking for Vision 
who should be coming for Wanda soon. Nekra thinks how useless Black Talon is 
compared to her, but that she allies herself with him to gain more to hate to 
fuel her powers. Nekra hides when she sees Starfox overhead. Nekra can’t find 
Vision so she heads back for Talon. Talon says that their ally will be there 
soon, and that they must guard against any surprises. They leave the Scarlet 
Witch thinking her unconscious, but she is really loosening her restraints with 
her power. Nekra dances about as Black Talon plays the bongos to raise the dead 
into zombie defenders. They return to find their ally the Grim Reaper is there. 
Nekra kisses Reaper and tells him that Talon’s dead men failed to capture 
Vision. Reaper starts to yell at Talon that Ultron completed his job and has 
captured Wonder Man. Talon says that he had two jobs while Nekra had none. 
Vision and Scarlet Witch suddenly attack them. When Vision hits Reaper, Nekra 
hits Vision to defend him. Wanda hexes Nekra lifting her head over heels. Nekra 
grabs Wanda by the throat. Vision hits Nekra, but Nekra is invulnerable from her 
hate. Wanda flips Nekra. Reaper defeats Wanda. Vision finds the body of a man 
that looks like Simon Williams. Reaper offers Vision Wanda for the body. After 
the trade Nekra and the others leave.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>West Coast Avengers vol. 2 #2- As Reaper tells 
Wonder Man that he isn’t his brother, but a genetic freak, Nekra cheers him on. 
Reaper says that he is going to get Vision and scan both of their brain 
patterns. One of Ultron’s machines will then eliminate any portion that isn’t 
common between the two. Reaper will then send that mind into a body that looks 
like Simon Wiliams and then he will have his brother back. Nekra is in Reaper’s 
arms. Ultron leaves to get Vision. Later Nekra lies on Reaper. She says that he 
is wild, but Reaper corrects her saying that he used to be wild, but since the 
Avengers killed his brother he has become an irresistible force. Nekra likes it 
when Reaper talks of his hate for the Avengers. She asks Reaper why he doesn’t 
hate Ultron for making Vision. Reaper says that Ultron serves his purpose for 
now. Suddenly M’Baku enters and tells Reaper that Wonder Man is waking up. 
Reaper goes off on him and starts hurling racial slurs at him. Reaper says that 
he hates “spades”. Nekra tells Reaper that she is black. Reaper says that she is 
the purest white he has ever seen. They kiss.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Vision and Scarlet Witch vol. 2 #2- Ultron has 
returned and now all the West Coast Avengers, save Mockingbird, are in 
energi-cages. Reaper goes over his plan again. When Ultron takes Simon out of 
his cage to scan his brain Simon decides to fight. Mockingbird frees the other 
West Coasters and the fight begins. Black Talon and Man-Ape desert Reaper for 
his racism. Nekra is left fighting Tigra and Hank Pym. Nekra tosses them aside 
and Nekra and Reaper make a run for it. Nekra and Reaper split up.</FONT></P>
