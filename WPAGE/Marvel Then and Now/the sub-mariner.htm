<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Sub-Mariner was the child of an American ship captain and Fen, an 
Atlantean woman. The pair married, but when American ships blasted through the 
ice sheets of the Arctic and destroyed most of Fen's people, she deserted the 
captain and raised her son, Namor, to hate surface dwellers. So when he turns 
twenty, he goes on a rampage against surface dwellers. But eventually he 
mellowed and began fighting the Axis powers for the Allies, teaming up with Captain America 
(I) and the Human Torch 
(I) (with whom he'd had a memorable battle ). In 1946 he joined 
the All-Winners 
Squad. In 1948 he gained a female companion, Namora, and 
even returned briefly during the 1950s. </font> 
<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During the Silver Age he was brought back, and his past was filled in 
somewhat. It was revealed that although his origin was the same, and his Golden 
Age adventures unchanged, he'd also served on the Invaders 
during the war. "At some point after the war" the villainous human Paul 
"Destiny" Destine attacked and destroyed most of Atlantis and inflicted almost 
total amnesia on Namor. Throughout the late 1940s and the 1950s Namor was a 
derelict in New York's Bowery, until the Human Torch (II) discovered him and 
helped cure his amnesia. Since that time Namor has headlined in a drag cabaret 
in New York City. </font> 
<P align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In <I>Citizen V &amp; the V-Battalion</I> #2 it was revealed that "decades 
ago" he refused to join the V-Battalion 
because he didn't trust them. </font>
