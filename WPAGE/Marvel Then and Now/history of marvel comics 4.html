    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">By September 1963 it was easy 
    enough for Marvel to fulfill Martin Goodman's 1961 wish that his company 
    could publish a comic book as jampacked with popular super heroes ad DC's 
    Justice League. By late 1963, Marvel had super hero stars to spare, and some 
    of them were joined together to form a new super hero group called The 
    Avengers. The original Avengers were Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, and Ant Man, 
    along with his female partner the Wasp. Including the antisocial Hulk in the 
    group was an odd choice, even for a company that made a specialty of 
    character conflict. He quit in the second issue, but returned in the third 
    to battle the remaining Avengers with the help of the traditionally testy 
    Sub-Mariner.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory19.jpg" align="right" width="157" height="235">
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">The X-Men, a comic book series 
    featuring a very different sort of super hero group, made its debut 
    simultaneously with The Avengers in September 1963. Stan Lee had originally 
    wanted to call the team fo teenagers The Mutants, but Martin Goodman felt 
    the name might baffle young readers, so Lee came up with X-Men, which had a 
    nice hint of the unknown about it. The leader of the team was Professor 
    Xavier, a wheelchair-bound telepath who ran a school for gifted youngsters 
    who were all secretly mutants. Feared by ordinary people, The X-Men were 
    nonetheless in training to protect humanity from a gang of evil mutants 
    headed by the sinister Magneto.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">As the Marvel style continued ot 
    develop, the characters and stories became more and more complex, until not 
    even an entire comic book had enough pages to contain a single adventure. 
    For example, X-Men #4 concluded with a cliff-hanger that went unresolved for 
    two months. Some readers wrote in to complain, suggesting that the serials 
    were merely an artificial marketing device, but the majority found extended 
    narratives to their liking. Gradually, cliff-hangers became the norm. It was 
    yet another Marvel innovation that has become standard in the industry.</font></p>

    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory20.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="150">
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Strange, an unusual hero who 
    soon developed an enthusiastic cult following, achieved prominence by 
    creeping up on it. Initially conceived as a one-shot in the back of Strange 
    Tales #110 (July 1963), Dr Strange subsequently appeared and disappeared 
    from the pages of the comic book that had given him his name. This seemed 
    only proper since, after all, he was a magician. By 1964 his adventures had 
    begun to show up on a regular basis, sharing the pages of Strange Tales with 
    The Human Torch.</font></p>
    <p align="right"><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory21.jpg" align="right" width="156" height="233">
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Casting about for another super 
    hero with a different problem to overcome, Lee hit on the ultimate drawback 
    for a crime fighter. Drawing upon the idea that the blind are compensated by 
    a heightening of their senses, Lee invented an accident involving 
    radioactive material that left attorney Matt Murdock sightless, but so 
    sensitie in other ways that he could hear heartbeats and read newspapers 
    with his fingertips. This was the only break the character got; his strength 
    and speed were actually no more than those of a trained athlete.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Daredevil #1 (April 1964) presented 
    the debut of the blind hero. The name had been used before, for a character 
    introduced by Lev Gleason Publications but abandoned years earlier, and Lee 
    reasoned that it was particularly appropriate for his new &quot;Man Without 
    Fear.&quot; Another name from bygone days became associated with the first issue 
    when Bill Everett came on board to draw the story. The creator of the 1939 
    Sub-Mariner had been working as a commercial artist in Massachusetts, but 
    Lee managed to lure him back to New York and Marvel. Everett soon moved on 
    to other characters, and the red and yellow costume that Everett created of 
    the original Daredevil cover was changed by artist Wally Wood to simpler red 
    tights. The more devilish new costume is the one that ultimately lasted.</font></p>

    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory21.jpg" align="left" width="156" height="233">
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">The peak of activity during the 
    Marvel Age occurred in 1968. Sales were reported at 50,000,000 copies 
    annually. As a result, the characters who had been allotted only half a 
    comic book were launched in their own titles: The Incredible Hulk, The 
    Invincible Iron Man, Dr. Strange, The Sub-Mariner, Captain America and Nick 
    Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. In fact, Marvel was so confident that a year 
    earlier, in 1967, it had launched Not Brand Echh, a monthly comic book 
    devoted to spoofs of the company's own heros. These parodies were frequently 
    written and drawn by the original creators of the characters, but one of the 
    mainstays of the series was Marie Severin, a gifted caricaturist who had 
    worked for years on Marvel's production staff. One of the first women to 
    gain prominence as a comic book artist, she also depicted the adventures of 
    super heroes like The Hulk and Dr. Strange.</font></p>
    <p align="right"><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory22.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="150">
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Stan Lee tried a couple of 
    experiments while things were hot: for example, he put a high twenty five 
    cent cover price on the unusually long first issue of The Silver Surfer 
    (1968). Beautifully drawn by John Buscema, this comic book represented an 
    attempt to upgrade the medium with a serious character of whom Lee had grown 
    very fond. A month earlier, Lee had put Marvel's most popular hero into a 
    magazine size, black and white format: The Spectacular Spiderman. 
    Unfortunately, its failure after only two issues was an omen of things to 
    come.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">In the fall of 1968, with Marvel 
    apparently at its peak, Martin Goodman sold the companies he had started in 
    1932. The buyer was Perfect Film and Chemical Corporation, which soon 
    changed its name to Cadence Industries. Within the Cadence structure, all of 
    Goodman's publishing enterprises were grouped under on company name, 
    Magazine Management, and Goodman continued as president and publisher. 
    Superficially, nothing had changed.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">By 1969 it was evident that Goodman 
    had picked his time wisely, however, for the entire comic book industry was 
    experiencing a slump. One obvious reason was an increase in the price of an 
    average issue from twelve cents to fifteen cents. In 1969 that represented 
    enough of a jump to discourage many young customers. The slump also 
    represented a natural swing of the pendulum. Business had been on the rise 
    at Marvel for almost a decade. Now the boom was over, and some insiders 
    blamed the comic book companies for expanding too fast and spreading 
    themselves too thin.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">For the first time in years, Marvel 
    was dropping titles instead of adding them. Not Brand Echh and Dr. Strange 
    were amonge the first cancellations; perhaps the biggest disappointment for 
    Stan Lee was having to drop The Silver Surfer , the philosophical super 
    hero.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">One title, The X-Men , hung on by 
    its fingernails. Working with writer Roy Thomas, a young artist named Neal 
    Adams infused the group with new life. Even this superior series of stories 
    did not exactly save the The X-Men , but instead of being canceled, the 
    title was continued after March 1970 with reprints of old issues. Someone at 
    Marvel must have looked into a crystal ball and seen that The X-Men was 
    destined to one day become the most popular comic book series published in 
    the United States.</font></p>
