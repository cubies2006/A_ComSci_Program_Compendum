src="DAREDEVIL MISTER HYDE_files/Hyde2.gif" width=271 align=left>The main 
difference between Dr. Henry Jekyll and Dr. Calvin Zabo, who both transform into 
different versions of Mr. Hyde, is that Calvin Zabo was already a disreputable 
sort. He had been fired from every job he ever held. Zabo used the time on his 
hands to create a formula to let him emulate his favorite story, Dr. Jekyll and 
Mr. Hyde. Zabo wished to unleash the primitive forces of man's nature. Hyde is 
the type that revels in his evil. He loves being Hyde. </P>

<P><FONT size=2>Journey into Mystery #99-100- After being rejected from a job 
with Dr. Donald Blake, which he wanted so that he could embezzle from him, Hyde 
decided to try and create the formula that would allow him to become a "real 
life" Mr. Hyde. Once he gained his power Hyde sought revenge against Don Blake. 
Hyde throws Blake out the window of his practice. Thor "rescues" Blake when 
Blake taps his cane on the building. Hyde hears of Thor's rescue of Blake, and 
plots for revenge against Thor. Hyde kidnaps Blake and Jane Foster and takes 
them to his castle. Hyde ties Blake to a post. He then sets a bomb in order to 
ensure Jane Foster's cooperation. Hyde steals a submarine. Blake manages to 
reach his cane and transform into Thor. Thor finds Hyde. Hyde throws a piece of 
the sub at Thor. Jane Foster stops Thor from going after Hyde because if Hyde is 
stopped then Hyde won't be able to stop the bomb that is supposed to be with Don 
Blake.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>

ingests his formula and turns into Hyde. In order to increase their odds against 
Thor Mr. Hyde and the Cobra team up. Hyde plans to use his Time Reversal Ray 
against Thor. By pointing it at Thor the two hope to learn of Thor's 
headquarters. Hyde draws Thor out in the open and the Cobra shoots him with the 
ray. They see Thor going into Don Blake's window. Hyde and Cobra kidnap Blake 
and Foster. Blake tells them that Thor will appear if they tap his cane. They 
all look out the window as Hyde taps the cane. Blake turns into Thor, and since 
the cane is now Thor's hammer Hyde falls to the ground. Hyde leads Thor to a 
heavy machinery show. Thor can't throw his hammer because &nbsp;of the people, 
but Hyde doesn't care so he starts throwing machines. When Thor is distracted 
Cobra uses a machine to lift Thor's hammer away from him. Thor causes a 
diversion and runs from Hyde and Cobra. The police arrive at the show. Once 
turned back into Don Blake he tries to release his hammer from the machine. Hyde 
threatens the crowd, but then spots Blake. He asks Blake how to get Thor back. 
Blake tells him his cane is in the same machine that Thor's hammer is in. Hyde 
tears apart the machine to get it. During the commotion Blake turns back into 
Thor. As Thor defeats Cobra Hyde decides to turn back into Zabo. Cobra is 
arrested, but Hyde escapes leaving Cobra to the police (kind of ironic 
considering Hyde's problems with Cobra later). Once in the clear Zabo turns back 
into Hyde because he wants to beat Thor in a fight. Thor defeats Hyde, and Hyde 
is taken into police custody.</FONT> </P>

is one of the good guys and to take a dive for Flag. Cobra smoothes things over

rescue Cap. Cap is washed down the drain in the pool. Cobra and Hyde follow him 
down to finish him off. Cap had developed a problem with his muscles freezing up

About that time Cap's muscles freeze up. Now I've had a little problem with Hyde

to finish him off- the vest shoots out an airbag to protect Cap. When Hyde 
breaks the bag it releases a gas that knocks Hyde out. Cobra gets up with 
handcuffs on and proceeds to choke Cap. Cap's vest releases something that wraps 
around Cobra and captures him. And Cobra and Hyde manage to lose to…. a vest.

turned Hulk into a wimp. He says that Hulk doesn’t accept death unless he does 
so with his teeth sunk into Death’s neck. Hyde says that they are two of a kind, 
and that when Mercy diminishes Hulk she diminishes him as well. Hyde tells Hulk 
to rise and fight him or after he has killed him he’ll go and find Rick and 
Betty and kill them as well. Hulk hits Hyde and shouts his name. Hyde jumps back 
on Hulk. He says that for Hulk to exist renders him redundant and he won’t have 
that. They trade blows. Hyde is on top of Hulk and Hulk says he can’t die 
against him. Hulk knocks Hyde out of the plane. Hyde rips the wing of the plane 
off and says he grants the gift of death to Hulk, his best friend. Hyde 
falls.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>Iron Man vol. 3 #43- Toy Stark has started working at Askew 
Industries and given away his vast fortune to the Avengers. A mad bomber has 
been sending bombs to tech companies. Last issue Stark discovers that he has the 
bomb on him. He is dressed in his armor and is trying to get to Avengers mansion 
to let the armor explode safely. Iron Man has fifteen minutes to get there, but 
when he leaves the building he finds Mister Hyde standing outside to stop him. 
Hyde starts throwing chunks of concrete at Iron Man. Stark figures that Hyde is 
trying to detonate the armor, and since he doesn’t know how sensitive the bomb 
is he does his best to dodge. Iron Man launches a few robotic probes that are 
supposed to explode, but because the armor is new the probes are untested and 
don’t work. Mister Hyde picks up a bus and is ready to throw it, but Iron Man 
activates a magnet and pulls the bus from Hyde’s grip. He sets the bus down and 
Hyde grabs Iron Man up in a bear hug from behind. Hyde cracks Iron Man’s rib 
through the armor. Iron Man expands his shields and blows Hyde off of him. Hyde 
looks up and sees the Avengers looking down at him. Hyde starts swinging, but 
quickly discovers that they are all illusions. Iron Man blasts Hyde unconscious. 
He has five minutes left before the detonation.</FONT></P>
