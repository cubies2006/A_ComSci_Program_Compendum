                        <P>Profile written by: Greg McQueen
                        <P>Was Matt's first love interest. They met at College, 
                        but he and Elektra split up after the death of her 
                        diplomat father during a hostage crisis which she and 
                        Matt were trying to solve. She was already a master 
                        martial artist and had killed many people due to 
                        schitzophrenic tendencies. When she left she went to 
                        study martial arts and for a year joined the Chaste in 
                        an attempt to find inner peace, but Stick told her to 
                        leave the order. In an attempt to prove her worth to 
                        Stick, she joined the Hand with the intentions of 
                        causing the groups' downfall from the inside, but she 
                        was eventually seduced by the group and became one of 
                        them. She eventually decided to leave the Hand, and 
                        moved to New York where she worked as the Kingpin's head 
                        assassin. However, after she didn't kill Foggy Nelson 
                        the Kingpin sent Bullseye to kill her. She died in 
                        Matt's arms. When the Hand found out about her death, 
                        they tried to revive her body using an ancient ninja 
                        technique, but were stopped from doing so by Stone (of 
                        the Chaste cult) and Daredevil. When Daredevil himself 
                        tried to bring her back to life, he somehow managed to 
                        cleanse her soul. Stone completed the revival ceremony 
                        and took her to the Chaste's hideaway without Matt 
                        knowing. She stayed there until the Hand tried to fuse 
                        the killer piece of her mind to their new Warrior 
                        Erynys, so she came off the mountain to stop them from 
                        doing this. During the battle she was reinfected with 
                        her evil side, and is now working as a freelance 
                        assassin again, but is having a large crisis of 
                        concience about her work.
