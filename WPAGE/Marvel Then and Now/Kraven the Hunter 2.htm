<P><FONT size=2>Amazing Spider-Man #15- After Spider-Man breaks up a meeting of 
criminals that the Chameleon was at Chameleon realizes he needs to get rid of 
Spider-Man. He thinks of his old friend Kraven the Hunter. JJ Jameson, Betty 
Brant, and Peter Parker all turn out to cover the arrival of Kraven the Hunter 
in New York. Kraven is world famous for capturing every type of animal single 
handedly. JJ tries to pay Kraven for an interview, but Kraven says he only came 
to hunt the most dangerous prey. Suddenly two gorillas and a cobra escape from 
their cages. Kraven scoops up the cobra, and throws it into a barrel. Kraven 
then hits the gorilla in the right nerve center. Kraven can’t get close enough 
to the other gorilla so he drugs it with a tranquilizer from his belt. Kraven 
then lifts the gorilla above his head. JJ asks Kraven what he is there to hunt. 
Kraven says that he is after Spider-Man. Jameson tells Kraven that there are 
laws against hunting people. Kraven says that they will see. Later Kraven meets 
with the Chameleon for information on Spider-Man. Chameleon tells Kraven not to 
under-estimate Spider-Man. Kraven tells Chameleon not to underestimate him. 
Kraven says that he possesses superhuman strength from the potion that he stole 
from a witch doctor. Kraven says he only needs one punch to stop an elephant’s 
charge. Later Kraven watches as Spider-Man brings down a robbery that the 
Chameleon set up so that Kraven might view his enemy. Kraven thinks to himself 
that Spider-Man is a worthy foe. Spidey swings away and comes face to face with 
Kraven. Spider-Man tries to leap over Kraven’s lunge, but Kraven grabs his foot 
and slams him against the ground. Spider-Man asks why Kraven is anti-Spidey. 
Kraven says his life is the hunt, but he had no goals for him to strive for 
until he learned of Spider-Man. Kraven lands a nerve punch, but Spider-Man 
twists enough so that only his left arm goes dead. Spider-Man hits <IMG

align=right></FONT><FONT size=2>Kraven with his good arm. Kraven realizes how 
strong he is. Kraven scratches Spider-Man with a potion that weakens him and 
makes him woozy. Kraven leaves saying that he can defeat Spider-Man anytime he 
wants now, but will prolong his enjoyment by waiting. Back with Chameleon Kraven 
explains that he is thrilled that Spider-Man is such a challenge. Kraven wants 
to plan their next trap. He says that his blood boils with anticipation. The 
next day Kraven tells JJ Jameson that he gives his word that Spider-Man’s days 
are numbered. JJ tells Kraven to be sure it is legal. Kraven tells JJ to watch 
his tone of voice. Later as Kraven drinks some more of his potion he explains to 
Chameleon that he knows Spider-Man will come after him because he has studied 
him, and knows his nature, his instincts. Kraven follows Spider-Man as 
Spider-Man follows Chameleon disguised as Kraven. Kraven springs a net on 
Spider-Man, but Spidey breaks the chain of the net and rolls out. Chameleon 
beats a jungle drum distracting Spider-Man. Kraven clamps a manacle on 
Spider-Man’s wrist, and one on his leg. They start to pull together from 
magnetic force. Kraven says the only key is around his neck. Spider-Man runs, 
but Kraven follows the bells in the manacles. Spidey webs up the manacles to 
make them quiet. Kraven doesn’t hear Spider-Man. He is taken by surprise when 
Spider-Man throws Chameleon’s mask at Kraven’s feet. Kraven tries to get away to 
form a new attack, but Spidey keeps finding him. Kraven attacks, but Spider-Man 
keeps dodging. Finally Kraven runs right into Spider-Man’s webbing. Spidey takes 
the key from Kraven’s neck, and notices that the potion has worn off. Spider-Man 
leaves Kraven there for the police. Kraven and Chameleon are deported. Kraven 
says he will train harder in the Congo, and come back for Spider-Man.</FONT>

with Dr. Octopus for the other members of their new group the Sinister Six.

why would they be able to now. Kraven says that each of them almost beat him, 
and that together they can’t fail. After Vulture and Sandman show up Dr. Octopus

each fight him in the order of the number they pick. Octopus says that each of 
them is assigned a location that plays to their strength. Electro and Sandman 
kidnap Betty Brant and coincidentally they get Aunt May as well. Vulture

size=2>West Coast Avengers vol. 2 #3- Tigra is by herself and discovers a group 
of thugs stealing. Anxious to prove herself after messing up against Ultron 
Tigra fights them. Her hair is suddenly grabbed from behind by Kraven. Kraven 
says, “We meet again, little one!” Kraven says that it is too bad he doesn’t 
have a slave collar for her this time. Tigra flips around Kraven, but Kraven 
spins and punches her. Tigra leaps at Kraven, but Kraven takes off one of his 
belt tusks that is treated with a poison. Tigra is left groggy, and Kraven makes 
off with his stolen art. Tigra collapses. Tigra gets back up and tracks Kraven 
to Griffith Park. Tigra sets off one of Kraven’s traps, but is fast enough to 
evade it. As Tigra leaps backwards, Kraven leaps out of a nearby tree onto her. 
Tigra grabs Kraven’s belt off of him, but Kraven quickly turns and nerve punches 
Tigra’s leg dead. Tigra swings and scratches open wounds on Kraven’s chest. 
Kraven takes some of his blood and tastes it. He says that his blood contains 
potions that give enhanced strength and speed. Tigra sees that Hawkeye and 
Mockingbird are looking for her. She wants to defeat Kraven by herself though so 
she throws Kraven into the thick of the trees. Kraven says that she should have 
called for help when she had the chance. Kraven throws darts at Tigra, but she 
dodges them. As she evades the darts a net drops onto her. Tigra growls and rips 
through the net. Kraven thinks that perhaps Tigra is too strong now. He throws 
something into her face to block her sense of smell and then runs. Tigra catches 
up to him. Kraven says that he can’t be seen fleeing and turns to fight. He pins 
Tigra on the ground. Tigra gets up, but Kraven hits a nerve point and Tigra 
falls over paralyzed. Kraven goes a branch of a tree and prepares to plunge it 
into her neck. Suddenly Kraven is wrapped up in one of Hawkeye’s arrows. 
Mockingbird tries to hit Kraven, but he dodges. Finally she trips him to the 
ground and knocks him out with her battle staves.</FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT size=2>Web of Spider-Man #31- Kraven seems to be practicing 
some moves in his trophy room. He throws a black panther off to one side. He 
stands before a giant ape and knocks its head clean off its shoulders with the 
palm of his hand. Kraven thinks about his mortality. Kraven is over seventy 
years old though his herbs and potions have kept him able bodied. He thinks 
about how his family left Russia right after the Czar was overthrown. He says 
that there was no more room for dignity and honor in the new Russia. Kraven 
thinks how this world seems to have followed Russia in dropping honor and 
dignity. Kraven says that he has found honor and morality in the hunt. He thinks 
how even herbs and potions cannot stave off death forever. He thinks that soon 
he will die…but not yet. Later Kraven crouches perfectly still as he waits naked 
in a white room. Slowly the room fills with spiders. When the spiders are up 
over his head Kraven leaps up and begins eating the spiders. Spider-Man is out 
swinging and he seems to hear a jungle beat in his head. Kraven leaps from a 
helicopter. He thinks about all the times that Spider-Man has beaten and 
humiliated him. He thinks how the Spider isn’t really human and how he seems to 
exist to test him. Kraven thinks how he cannot rest until he has proven himself. 
Spider-Man is edgy and he gets hit by a blow dart. Spider-Man spots Kraven and 
leaps to him, but the drug on the dart takes effect. Kraven hits Spider-Man with 
his staff. As Spidey is getting up Kraven throws a specialized net onto him. 
Kraven leaps down and pulls a rifle off his shoulder. Kraven says, “Honor…will 
be restored.” Spider-Man tries to engage Kraven in talking, but Kraven simply 
shoots Spider-Man. Later Kraven stands in the rain at Spider-Man’s funeral. He 
throws the first shovel of dirt on and then laughs. Kraven walks away as the 
rest of the grave is filled.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Amazing Spider-Man #293- Kraven stands in a 
black Spider-Man costume by Spider-Man’s grave. He pulls his own mask off and 
laughs. Kraven leaps along the buildings in Spider-Man’s costume. He say that it 
isn’t enough just to kill Spider-Man, but that he needs to become him and prove 
he is superior. Kraven enters his home and into the spider room. He drinks a 
poison that is supposed to expand his mind. To let the Kraven out and let the 
Spider in. The spiders all seem to converge into one giant spider. Kraven runs 
from the spider, but then overcomes his fear and attacks it. The wave of spiders 
seems to swallow him up. Later Kraven, in his spider suit, comes across Mary 
Jane who is about to be raped by two men. He lands next to them and smashes one 
of their faces against the brick wall. The other one tries to get away, but 
Kraven grabs him and beats him unconscious. He only stops when Mary Jane screams 
for him to. Kraven leaps away, and Mary Jane knows that it wasn’t Peter.

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Spectacular Spider-Man #131- For weeks Kraven 
has been hunting in the Spider costume. He leaps into a warehouse with drug 
dealers inside. He savagely beats them and finishes by snapping the neck of one 
that tried to shoot him. The police come in and Kraven leaps out the window. The 
cops find the guy dead. Kraven climbs up to a rooftop. He pulls his mask off and 
shouts, “I am Kraven” to assert his own identity. Kraven says that he has proven 
himself in nearly every way. He says that the final test is to come. At home 
Kraven is in his robe. He is trying to stab a rat in a cage with a knife. The 
city has been terrorized by Vermin who has been attacking and eating people. The 
last time Spider-Man fought Vermin he beat Vermin, but only because Captain 
America helped him. Kraven changes into the Spider suit and goes to hunt. Kraven 
walks through the sewer and finds Vermin. He gets Vermin to admit that “he” 
never would have beaten Vermin if nit for Captain America’s help. Kraven then 
proceeds to beat Vermin unconscious. Kraven emerges from the sewer carrying 
Vermin’s unconscious body. Spider-Man emerges from his grave. </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Web of Spider-Man #32- Spider-Man enters 
Kraven’s house and finds out that he has been “dead” for two weeks, and that 
Kraven has been masquerading as him nightly. Kraven senses that Spider-Man is 
coming for him. After stopping to see Mary Jane Spider-Man finds Kraven. 
</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Amazing Spider-Man #294- Kraven recalls how they 
said that his mother was insane, and how his father’s spirit was broken when 
they were chased out of Russia. He recalls how they said his mother was insane 
and that she killed herself. Kraven thinks how they lied. He thinks how her life 
was stolen by the poverty around her that stole her life. Stolen by the Spider… 
Spider-Man leaps off the ceiling and grabs Kraven. He punches Kraven in the 
mouth. Kraven spits out blood and smiles. Kraven tells Spider-Man to hit him as 
much as he wants, and that he won’t resist him. Kraven says that he no longer 
needs to fight because he has already won. He says that he killed him and 
replaced him. Spider-Man says that he was only drugged. Kraven says that if had 
wished it he could have just as easily been killed, but that he wanted 
Spider-Man to know that he had won. Kraven says that he has proven himself 
superior to him in replacing him. Kraven changes out of his Spider costume and 
gets dressed as Kraven again. Kraven tells Spider-Man to follow him. Spider-Man 
hesitates but follows. Down in Kraven’s basement he has Vermin in an electrified 
cage. Kraven says that he did alone what Spider-Man and Captain America were 
barely able to do together. Spider-Man grabs Kraven furious. Kraven leaps onto 
an elephant and bellows his triumph. Spider-Man lifts the elephant and knocks 
Kraven off. Kraven holds Spider-Man’s face somewhat sad that Spider-Man is no 
longer his burden. Spider-Man knocks his hand away. Suddenly Kraven opens the 
cage releasing Vermin. Kraven gets Vermin to fight and watches as Vermin gets 
the upper hand on Spider-Man. Kraven throws a knife through Vermin’s hand to 
stop him from eating Spider-Man. Kraven says that the point has been made and 
that Vermin is free to go. Vermin runs off. Kraven helps Spider-Man up and tells 
him to go stop Vermin. Spider-Man says that he can’t just leave Kraven to hunt 
and ruin other’s lives. Kraven says that Spider-Man knows he is a man of his 
word. He gives Spider-Man his word that he will never hunt again. Spider-Man 
leaves. Kraven walks over and looks at the picture of him, his father, and 
mother. He thinks, “They said my mother was insane”, and then he blows his head 
off with a rifle. Kraven falls back into his casket.</FONT></P>
