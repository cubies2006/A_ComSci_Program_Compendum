width=388 align=left>Max Dillon was an ordinary power line worker, well not 
average...he was the best. Max was so egotistical that he couldn't even be 
bothered to save the life of his fellow worker unless he was given a hundred 
dollar bonus by his boss. Electro saved his co-worker, and got much more than 
his bonus when the power line he was on was struck by lightning. The lightning 
combined with the power on the pole left Max Dillon feeling better than he ever 
felt before. He also discovered that he now had the power of Electro. Being the 
petty man that he was Max immediately figured that he could use his newfound 
powers to gain vast wealth stealing.</P>
<P align=left><FONT size=2>Amazing Spider-Man #422- flashback- In Endicott, New 
York a young Max Dillon stands looking in the refrigerator as his mother tells 
his father that dinner is ready. His father says that he is still doing the tax 
forms. His mom tells him to take his time, and that she and Max will go ahead 
and eat without him. His father gets up and smacks his mother in the face. He 
says that he puts the food on the table, and that they will eat as a family or 
not at all. Max yells to stop hitting her, but his father just tells him to shut 
up. His father says that Max and his mother are useless, and that they are both 
sucking the life out of him.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Amazing Spider-Man #422- flashback- An eight 
year old Max holds his mother as his father leaves them. Max held his mother, 
but inside he was glad that his father was gone. Max’s mother tells him that he 
is all she has left for the first time. These words become a constant in Max’s 
life. </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Amazing Spider-Man #422- flashback- Max watches 
some boys playing basketball. His mother comes by and tells him that she said to 
stay away from those boys. She says that they play too rough for a fragile boy 
like him. She has him put on his jacket and Max walks away holding his mother’s 
hand.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Amazing Spider-Man #422- flashback- Max comes 
home with a bunch of college textbooks. He tells his mother that he wants to 
study to be an electrical engineer. His mother says that he would never survive 
on his own, and that he isn’t smart enough to do that. She tells him that if he 
is so interested in electricity that he should apply for a job at the local 
electric company. She says that she wishes he would pick something safer, like 
accounting the way his father did. She takes his books and throws them out the 
window. Max watches his dreams fly away. He doesn’t blame his mother, after all 
he is all she has.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Amazing Spider-Man #422- flashback- Max stands 
at his mother’s grave three weeks before his twenty-fifth birthday.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Amazing Spider-Man #422- flashback- Six months 
after his mother’s death Max marries Norma Lynn. They both work at the electric 
company. Norma was one of the boss’ secretaries. Max moved from job to job until 
he became a lineman. Norma tells Max that he ought to apply for a management 
position, or try to become an engineer like he wanted. Max repeats his mother 
saying that it is too much pressure, and that he doesn’t have the brains for it. 
</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Amazing Spider-Man #422- flashback- Norma gets 
tired of settling with Max and walks out on him.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Amazing Spider-Man #9- flashback- Electric lineman Max Dillon 
waits for a bonus from his boss before attempting to rescue a fellow worker in 
trouble. Max lowers the guy down, but while he is still up there he is struck by 
lightning. Because of the way Max held the electric wires the two bolts were 
canceled out, and left him feeling stronger than ever. Later a bunch of metal 
coat hangers stick to Max’s body, and he realizes that electricity is running 
through his body. Max practices throwing the electricity. He takes every cent he 
had and buys a run down house and makes it into an electricity lab. Max boosts 
his power by absorbing electricity. Max designs his Electro costume.</FONT> </P>

Dillon puts on his Electro costume. He then charges himself up with power just 
in case, and then heads out. Electro walks up to an armored car. He tells the 
guards not to bother putting the gold they have in the truck. They see Electro’s 
costume, and figure him for a crackpot. Electro zaps the gun and the bag of gold 
out of their hands. Electro then surrounds all the guards with a ring of 
electricity until they give him the bags. The next day at the Forest Hills bank 
the guard notices a flash of lightning. He goes to ring the alarm, but as he 
touches it Electro blasts him knocking out both the guard and the alarm. Electro 
walks in as J Jonah Jameson is trying to get some figures. JJ says that Electro 
can’t do this so Electro stuns them electrifying their tie pins and belt 
buckles. Electro uses his power to open the time locked vault. JJ figures that 
since Electro recognized him that it must be someone he knows. Minutes later 
Electro makes off with a bag of cash. Electro scales the outside of the building 
using his electric power on the iron beams to act like magnets. JJ figures the 
swagger and the climbing means that Spider-Man is Electro. JJ prints it in the 
paper, and everyone figures it must be true if it’s in print. Aunt May needs an 
operation. Peter asks JJ for one thousand dollars. JJ refuses, but offers Peter 
the money for a photo that proves Spider-Man is Electro. Peter takes off to 
capture Electro and collect the reward on him. Spider-Man finds Electro using 
his power like a mine detector. He finds a hidden safe and steals the contents. 
Electro spots Spider-Man and tries to blast him. He says he has wanted to prove 
his power was greater than Spider-Man's. Spidey webs Electro’s face and then 
goes down to grab him. Electro burns the webbing off his face, and then blasts 
Spidey as Spidey puts his hand on him. Electro leaves. Peter gives Jameson 
“proof” of Electro being Spider-Man to get the money. Electro laughs as he reads 
the paper since he thinks Spider-Man dead, and unable to clear his name. Electro 
breaks a bunch of prisoners about to be sent to the federal pen. Electro frees 
them to be his goons. The police surround the building, and Electro tries to 
assert control over the inmates. Spider-Man puts on rubber boots and gloves. 
Spider-Man keeps throwing metal objects past Electro to divert his power towards 
them. Spider-Man punches Electro. Electro releases a powerful electrical blast 
to revitalize himself. Spider-Man trips Electro with some bearings. Electro 
hides while his goons run from Spider-Man. Electro tries blasting Spider-Man 
both with his power and a gun. Spider-Man kicks sand at Electro. Electro turns 
the sand to glass, but it gives Spidey time to web Electro’s gun. Electro picks 
up some power wires and starts whipping them around. Spider-Man bumps into a 
firehouse. Spider-Man sprays Electro and short-circuits him. Spidey unmasks 
Electro, but has no idea who he is.</FONT></P>

Kraven wait with Dr. Octopus for the other members of their new group the 
Sinister Six. Mysterio arrives. Electro says that if each of them failed to beat 
Spider-Man why would they be able to now. Kraven says that each of them almost 
beat him, and that together they can’t fail. After Vulture and Sandman show up 
Dr. Octopus tells them his plan. He has each of them to draw a number, and that 
they will each fight him in the order of the number they pick. Octopus says that 
each of them is assigned a location that plays to their strength. Electro and 
Sandman kidnap Betty Brant and coincidentally they get Aunt May as well. Vulture 
delivers the message to Jameson that they want Spider-Man to go to Stark 
Electric Plant building four. Parker is there with Jameson, but he has seemingly 
lost his Spider powers. Peter goes and finds Electro. Electro says that if 
Spider-Man manages to beat him he has a card telling Spider-Man where to go 
next. Electro shoots a bolt at Spider-Man. Spidey realizes that his powers are 
back. Electro keeps throwing bolts, but Spidey keeps dodging. Electro recharges 
himself using the plant. Spider-Man runs and finds a way to ground himself. He 
then turns the power in the plant off. Electro hits him with a giant bolt, but 
Spidey is unaffected. Spider-Man knocks out Electro. He takes the card with the 
next location and goes. Spider-Man defeats the others and saves Aunt May and 
Betty Brant. Electro is seen in a jail cell with the others. Dr. Octopus tries 
to start planning for next time, but Electro tells him to shut up.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>Omega the Unknown #1- behind the scenes- Electro happens upon 
Omega defeating the Metal Man. </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Omega the Unknown #2- As Omega carries off the 
defeated Metal Man, Electro calls out to Omega from atop a building. When Omega 
looks up Electro says it isn’t Omega he wants because he already has him pegged 
as a hero-type, but he does have a use for the robot. Electro blasts Omega and 
knocks him out. Electro leaps off the building and says that the robot just 
impressed him more. Electro admits that he didn’t see how Omega defeated it, but 
that with his electrical skills he will get it working again. Electro thanks 
Omega for his help, and drags the robot off. The next day Omega is fighting the 
Hulk. Suddenly Omega is blasted, and knocked out, by Electro’s charge. Electro 
zaps the Hulk and makes off with Omega attached to the bottom of a helicopter’s 
rope ladder.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Omega the Unknown #3- Omega wakes up, in an 
abandoned subway area, with his hands manacled in strength sapping restraints. 
Electro tells Omega that it’s more fun having Omega awake. Electro says that he 
can tell by the way he struggles against his restraints that he’ll be big in 
superheroing provided he doesn’t kill him first. Electro says to live all Omega 
has to do is get that robot working for him, and then Omega can regain his 
dignity when Electro takes his manacles off. The silent Omega takes an instant 
dislike to Electro, both because of his swagger and the fact that Electro knows 
just how to needle him. Omega kicks Electro into the robot. Electro blasts 
Omega’s manacles to shock him. The robot falls onto the third rail. Later 
Electro says that Omega didn’t tell him that the robot had a mind of his own. 
Electro says that he has struck a deal with the robot. Electro says that after a 
job together Electro is going to give the robot two things: his full power back 
and Omega to kill. They leave to do their job. Electro and the robot take over a 
television studio where they are running a telethon for the handicapped. Electro 
appears on the television, and says that the telethon is now for him. Omega 
smashes into the studio. He quickly smashes the robot. Electro tells Omega to 
stay back or he will hurt the handicapped child. Omega raises his hands toward 
Electro. Electro sense Omega’s intention, and raises his own hands. Their powers 
meet in air. They are evenly matched until the handicapped kid hits Electro in 
the leg with a crutch. Electro looks over and Omega’s power blasts him out.

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Marvel Team-Up #56- Peter Parker comes into the 
Daily Bugle to find a bunch of goons surrounding the staff. Peter hears trouble 
inside JJ Jameson’s office. Peter sneaks about and looks through a small window 
above a door. He sees Electro sitting in JJ’s chair. Blizzard and two goons are 
surrounding JJ. Electro says that they let JJ publish his morning edition, but 
he tried to double cross them right away. Some goons come in with Bushkin, the 
editor of the Daily Globe. Bushkin and Jameson start to fight. Electro tells 
them to shut up. Blizzard says that he thinks that they need to teach Jameson a 
lesson. Electro shows Jameson his phony headline about a strike that isn’t 
happening. The first words of each line spell “HELP BLACK MAIL”. Jameson asks 
what they want from him. Electro says that they want money. Money for not 
wrecking their businesses. Electro says that soon the whole city will be paying 
tribute to them. Suddenly Daredevil leaps through the window and kicks Electro 
in the back of the head. Daredevil saw one of the sabotaged papers and figured 
out the clue. He says that the police are on their way. Spider-Man is outside 
the door now fighting some of the goons. Electro and Blizzard run for it. 
Spider-Man and Daredevil bump into each other (?) as they chase after them. 
Electro and Blizzard accidentally run into the basement instead of to the ground 
floor. Electro spots Spider-Man with Daredevil. They try to sneak a shot off, 
but Spidey and Daredevil dodge. Spider-Man decks Electro and then dodges a 
blast. Electro cuts Spider-Man’s webbing with a bolt sending him straight 
towards a printing press. Daredevil gets Blizzard to shoot an ice beam at him. 
When Daredevil dodges the beam it creates an ice bridge for Spidey to slide away 
on. Spidey needs to help Daredevil so he webs Electro’s eyes. Electro lashes out

<P><FONT size=2>Spectacular Spider-Man #39- Electro, following instructions he 
received, walks to an abandoned auto body shop. Electro zaps the garage door 
activating it. Electro announces that he is there. The Wizard says that it is 
good he is on time because he likes his allies to be punctual. Sandman says that 
he isn’t with them until he proves he is worthy. Trapster says nothing, but 
fires a paste at Electro. Electro zaps the paste causing it to solidify in 
mid-air. Electro then does the same thing to Sandman’s body. Electro says that 
beating them is useless because it is their leader he wants to impress. Electro 
creates an electrical storm around Wizard short-circuiting him. Electro says now 
that he has proven himself he wants to talk about how they are going to bring 
down Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Spectacular Spider-Man #42- The new Frightful Four lands on the 
Statue of Liberty. Sandman asks Electro to help him lift their inflatable boat 
out of the water. Electro says that he didn’t join the Frightful Four to do 
manual labor. The guards hear their arguing and come over. Electro knocks the 
guards out with an electrical zap. Sandman reminds Electro that he is just one 
quarter of the Frightful Four, and that if he gets outta line he will have to 
answer to the others. Spider-Man spots a message above the Statue of Liberty 
that the Human Torch wants to meet him (though he probably should have suspected 
a trap since it was actually signed “Human Torch”. As the message fades Trapster 
asks Wizard if he should write the message with the flame-thrower again. Wizard 
says that Spider-Man will come. Electro dons a suit designed by the Wizard that 
is flameproof on the inside, but on the outside the flames give the appearance 
that he is the Human Torch. Electro “flies” along the cables inside the arm of 
the Statue. Spider-Man’s spider-sense goes off. Spidey dodges Electro’s electric 
blast. All the Frightful Four team up against Spidey. Trapster binds him with 
paste. Electro tries to unmask Spider-Man, but the paste gag holds the mask on 
tight. Wizard shows up with another Spider-Man costume.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Fantastic Four #218- Electro rides on the 
Wizard’s antigravity craft with the other Frightful Four, Sandman and Wizard 
with a bound and gagged Spider-Man, as they watch the Trapster dressed as 
Spider-Man climbing the Baxter Building. They take off as Trapster gets in. 
“Spidey” warns Torch about the Frightful Four. When Torch turns Trapster knocks 
him out. He binds him in paste. Trapster turns off the alarm as he fight with 
Thing. Electro and the others enter the Baxter Building through the roof. Susan 
Richards is in her robe looking for Reed when she spots Torch bound up. She 
tries to turn invisible, but her robe doesn’t. Electro uses his powers to create 
an electromagnetic storm around her. The storm carbonizes the atoms leaving Sue 
stuck in rock hard electrocarbon atoms. Wizard says that he is glad Electro 
likes his plan. Wizard, Sandman, Trapster, and Electro sneak up behind Reed. 
Sandman holds Reed in place as Trapster pastes him to super-conductive 
machinery. Electro lights Reed up. Suddenly Spider-Man comes crashing through 
the ceiling to save Reed. He jumps on Wizard. Electro tries to blast him, but 
Spidey leaps off and Electro hits Wizard. Reed gets free and vacuums up Sandman. 
Spider-Man wraps Electro up in a fire hose. He pulls it spinning Electro around, 
and then kicks him unconscious. Electro wakes up, but is wrapped up in the hose 
again.</FONT></P>

he has been locked up in this place twice now, and he is looking for 
payback.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Avengers #237- Electro and the others discover, 
using the security cameras console, that the Avengers and Spider-Man are at the 
scene. Electro says that he doesn’t know if they can beat them. Rhino says that 
he doesn’t care if there are a hundred Avengers he wants to level the place. 
Rhino tells Electro to watch Blackout because he doesn’t trust him. As Blackout 
starts to rant about his dark light powers Electro whispers to Moonstone that 
Blackout’s powers can’t possible be dark light (which is only ultraviolet). 
Moonstone tells Electro that she knows it is something else, but that Blackout 
doesn’t seem to. Moonstone has Electro shoot a bolt of electricity near the two 
of them to stop them. She says that they need to stick together. Electro and the 
others wall themselves up in the Research Dome inside Blackout’s darkforce. The 
She-Hulk comes along and knocks a hole in it, but as soon as she does Electro 
shocks her. Moonstone appears on the screen saying that Electro will shock them 
all. Electro’s powers start to flow out of the darkforce wall. The Scarlet Witch 
uses a hex to bring the dark wall down, and causes Electro’s power to feedback 
on him. The fight begins. As Rhino is charging Spider-Man, Electro figures to 
use his energy booster to really fry Spidey. Captain America throws his shield 
and severs Electro’s connection to his extra power. Electro says that doesn’t 
matter because he already is carrying enough. Electro tries to blast Cap, but 
the Scarlet Witch puts a hex on him. Electro passes out from lack of oxygen as 
Wanda turned the oxygen into carbon dioxide. Moonstone and Blackout 
escape.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Falcon #3- Falcon spots a few of the gang 
members he is chasing down outside the scene of an arson. The look Falcon gives 
them is seen by Electro, who is watching everything from his window. Electro 
figures that the look was meant for him, and that Falcon has recognized him. 
Electro says that he won’t let that second stringer take him back to jail. He 
says that he will kill him first. The next day Max Dillon sees Falcon again this 
time talking down a jumper. Max is completely paranoid. He says that Falcon is 
making up these emergencies to watch him, and that all the people around him are 
probably SHIELD agents waiting on his word to attack. Electro says that if he 
sees Falcon again he is gonna kill him. In a few minutes the president’s 
motorcade happens to be passing through the neighborhood. An explosion goes off 
and the Legion, the gang’s name, takes the president hostage. Falcon arrives to 
help, but Electro blasts Falcon in the back. He tells Falcon to stop playing 
games, and that he is right there. Falcon of course has no idea what he is 
talking about. Electro blasts him again as Falcon tries to fly away. Falcon 
realizes that as long as he isn’t grounded Electro’s bolts don’t hurt as much. 
Falcon flies away. A guy with a gun confronts Electro. Falcon is confronting the 
stronghold of the Legion as Electro catches up to him. Electro says that he has 
come to finish what they started. Electro somehow rips a light pole down and 
tries to hit Falcon with it as he electrifies it. Falcon tries flying by and 
punching Electro. Falcon snaps Electro’s electromagnetic lines of force. Falcon 
is blasted back and falls unconscious. Electro is crowing about how he won when 
he sees Redwing. Electro starts to see spots and passes out.</FONT></P>

stronghold. He says that he wants to know where the president is being held. 
They give Electro attitude so he blasts one of them. Electro asks again where 
the president is, and says that he won’t ask again. Falcon had Redwing follow 
Electro so that he would know where he was going. Electro arrives at the 
president’s location. Electro is running low on power so he takes a power line, 
breaks it apart, and starts sucking up the energy. All charged up Electro 
electrifies his feet. He jumps on the roof and sinks to the level where the 
president is. Electro sees Captain America and with the element of surprise 
electrifies him unconscious. Electro asks the president who is going to save him 
now. Falcon flies in and hits Electro. Sergeant Tork tries to stop Electro with 
a shotgun, but Electro zaps him and runs after Falcon. Electro quickly catches 
up with Falcon as he glides on an electromagnetic force field. Electro asks 
Falcon why he is prolonging this fight. Electro sees that Falcon’s flight is 
controlled by a pack. He manipulates the electrical parts so that it no longer 
works. Falcon dodges Electro’s blasts with acrobatic moves. Electro has Falcon 
cornered when Redwing flies along and scratches Electro’s back. While Electro is 
distracted Falcon hoses Electro down with a firehose. With Electro’s powers 
negated Falcon hits Electro with one punch and knocks him out. Falcon returns 
with Electro tied up in the firehose.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>Spider-Man #18- Electro welcomes the Sandman back to the 
Sinister Six, a little grouping of people who want to get revenge on Doctor 
Octopus. Electro says they will gain revenge on Ock for betraying them. Sandman 
says that he doesn’t care why they want him, but he wants to get revenge for Ock 
blowing up the Casada’s house (the people Sandman was staying with). Sandman 
visits Mrs. Casada in the hospital, and thinks that he doesn’t trust his new 
partners. He thinks about getting back up. Later Electro tells the others that 
he nearly killed a guy to get the info on Doc’s hideout. Doc Ock tells them that 
he has been expecting them. Electro tells Ock to give it up, but Ock says that 
that is what he was going to say. </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Spider-Man #19- Octopus tells them to join him 
or die. He attacks them all with his newly refound adamantium arms. Sandman 
finds out that it was the Sinister Six that blew up the Casada’s house to bring 
him into their group. Ock turns Sandman to glass. Spider-Man dives in and hits 
Electro and Mysterio. As they fight the Hulk drops through the ceiling. He says, 
“knock knock”. Electro says, “Oh Lordy, it’s the Hulk!” Hulk says that he is 
supposed to say, “Who’s there?” Electro unloads a huge electrical blast on Hulk. 
Hulk gives Electro “the finger” (a one finger knockout). Electro wakes in time 
to see Ock has defeated both Spider-Man and the Hulk (….right). He says they’ll 
join up with him again for now. They fly away, and Electro thinks to himself 
that the money Octopus paid him to re-assemble the Sinister Six for him puts him 
ahead of the other members.</FONT></P>

world and kill the sinners. Doc Ock tells them to prepare to leave as they won’t 
be coming back. Later Doc Ock tells the Sinister Six that they are going to take 
over Hydra’s base for their own. Hydra has a satellite with enough weapons to 
blow up the earth twenty times. Ock smashes the glass Sandman before leaving. 
Electro, and the others, are at the Hydra base blasting away. Suddenly Hulk, 
Spider-Man, Ghost Rider, and Sleepwalker burst through the wall. Electro blasts 
Sleepwalker. The fight goes on until Doctor Octopus summons the new member they

swings in and punches Electro. Electro says that he can’t believe he breaks out 
of jail and immediately runs into Spider-Man. He says that maybe he should move 
to Milwaukee. Spider-Man hits Electro with webbing, but just then a robot (sent 
by Smythe) flies onto the scene and after Spidey. Electro says it looks like the 
big robot wants a piece of Spidey, and he wishes him bon appetit. Electro finds 
that the police grabbed his diamonds, and so he figures he will stick around 
long enough to help his new “partner” kill Spider-Man. Electro tries to blast

Con Max. They are introducing that through miniaturization they have harnessed 
the power of a nuclear reactor inside a reactor the size of a microwave. Electro 
grabs the miniaturized reactor. He laughs as the energy courses through his 
body. Electro says that he feels like an electrical element. She-Hulk says that 
there are four elements: fire, water, air, and earth. She says that he is not an 
element. Electro growls at her. Electro blasts She-Hulk. He tells her that she 
is beneath his notice now. Suddenly Tommy, She-Hulk’s wannabe sidekick, jumps 
out to help She-Hulk. She-Hulk says that Electro could light up the Chrysler 
building right now. She pushes Tommy over and runs over. Electro says that his 
former self used to be scared of the super hero type. He blasts She-Hulk again. 
She-Hulk says that she is going to smash that generator, but the Con Max guy 
tells her that it is a nuclear generator. She-Hulk insulates her hands and hits 
Electro. Electro says that he felt that. She-Hulk says that Electro is nothing 
but a two-bit punk with some volts. Electro freaks saying that he is Zeus. Power 
pours out of him and shocks She-Hulk. Suddenly Electro’s generator dies out.

size=2>Max Dillon is working for a carnival as the “Amazing Electro”. They strap 
him into an electric chair and flip the switch. Bolts run through his body. 
Electro’s favorite part is when he suddenly opens his eyes after they’re done 
shocking him. The crowd cheers and Max feels good about himself. Max tells the 
barker that he is gonna go get some grub. The barker says that he has one more 
trick to do first. Max says that he said he didn’t want to do that trick 
anymore. The barker says that he either does the trick or he is fired. The 
barker sticks a light bulb in Electro’s mouth and it lights up. Everyone starts 
to laugh at Electro. Electro gets mad and the light bulb bursts in his mouth. 
Later Max is walking down the street. He sees a storm coming up and thinks about 
how much he loves lightning and thunder. He remembers that when he was a kid he 
used to like to sneak out and run around in the rain during thunderstorms. Max 
recalls how his overprotective mother would call him in and make him take his 
temperature. Max supposes that she was just so overprotective because his father 
died (or as revealed later abandoned them), and he was all she had left. Electro 
walks into a store and tries to buy a bottle of something, but the clerk and the 
woman she is talking to don’t even interrupt their conversation to help him. Max 
walks out thinking that whole his whole life has been this way. He says that 
even when his mother let him play with other children they never liked him, or 
even picked on him, they just ignored him. Max shouts that he isn’t a nobody as 
a bolt of lightning strikes him from the sky. Max thinks how nothing changed for 
him after his mother’s death except that he got a wonderful job working with 
electric lines. Max thinks how he used to dream of tapping the power, and how 
the freak accident that should have killed him instead made him reborn. Electro 
shouts that he isn’t Max Dillon, that he is Electro. Max thinks how when he 
would walk into a bank dressed as Electro that everyone would take notice of 
him. He says that it is no wonder he feels so small again always being defeated 
by Spider-Man and put in jail. Suddenly Electro gets an idea. Some time later 
Electro gets off a bus in New York City. A panhandler asks Electro for some 
change. He looks up at The Top of New York hotel and thinks how it is his 
destiny. The panhandler is still harassing Max so Max shoots a bolt of 
electricity at him though not meaning to. Later in a hotel room Max gets into 
his Electro gear thinking how if he pulls this off everybody will remember him. 
He blasts The Top of New York’s roof, and says that he is gonna light the 
night.</FONT></P>

some reason he couldn’t. He thinks that tonight is the night. A guy bumps into 
Max. Max gets ready to blast the guy, but thinks to himself that it isn’t time 
yet. As Max walks away the panhandler from yesterday walks up to The Top of New 
York, and thinks that tonight is the night. Later Electro stands on top of his 
hotel. He thinks how this might not work, and that he might die, but then thinks 
to himself that he is dead already. He decides that if he is going to die he is 
going to die big. Electro thinks how scared he is, and how his mother never 
wanted him to risk anything because he was “mama’s delicate flower”. Electro 
decides he is doing it, and rides to The Top of New York on a bolt of 
electricity. Electro hooks himself up to The Top of New York sign on the roof. 
Electro grabs the sign and starts sucking up power. The entire city blacks out. 
Electro releases a huge burst of energy into the sky.</FONT></P>

bathes in the amazement of the crowd, as he knows that every person in the city 
is staring up at him in fear and awe. He says that he is a supernova. He thinks 
how people will tell the children and their grandchildren about the day the 
lights went out, a man stood and lit the night. Spider-Man just happens to be 
inside The Top of the World hotel stopping the panhandler who decided to call 
himself Crook Man. Spider-Man hears that there is something going on up on the 
roof. Electro says that he is glad to see Spider-Man because he is the one that 
continually beat him down. Electro shouts that he is the King of New York or the 
King of the World. Spidey spider-sense goes nuts as Electro blows him off the 
roof with a bolt. Electro shouts that he is lucky that he doesn’t swat them all 
the way he did to Spider-Man. Electro tries to suck more and more in when 
suddenly he feels as though his head is about to explode. Electro then finds 
that he can't discharge the energy anymore. He pulls out the cables that was 
linking him to the power, but he finds that he is still caged by the power. 
Spider-Man makes his way back onto the roof. Electro scowls at Spider-Man, but 
then softens and asks Spider-Man for help. Electro asks what he is gonna do. 
Spider-Man tells Electro to just stay calm. Electro freaks saying that 
Spider-Man doesn’t know what it is like to feel small and alone. He says that 
now he will be alone and cut off from everything. He says that being Electro was 
the only thing that made him feel big, and now he has lost that too. Electro 
says that he may as well be dead, but then shouts that he doesn’t want to die. 
The energy field around Electro grows bigger and bigger. Spider-Man says that 
under the mask he is a human too. He says that he used to be the geek, and he 
used the costume to make himself feel more confidant. However one day Spidey 
says he realized that the confidence came from him just like it comes from Max 
Dillon, not Electro. Spidey webs up his hands and puts the cables back into the 
power source. Spidey tells Electro to be confident in himself, and to send the 
power out of himself and back into the source. Electro does it, and then thanks 
Spidey for his help. He says that he finally found someone who understands. 
Electro says that he will be happy to go to jail. The news cameras come over and 
Electro starts to tell them how great Spider-Man is.</FONT></P>

force. Delilah tells him that this is his last chance to reconsider. Max tells 
her to go ahead, and that his power is all he has. Max thinks how this jolt will 
geometrically increase his electrical field if he is right, but that if he is 
wrong it will kill him. Delilah throws the switch. Later the Rose returns and

surrounds the entire planet. Rose congratulates him on his experiment. Electro 
says that he owes Rose and Delilah, and that he now has a shot when People 
magazine releases the years Top 10 Supervillains. Rose says that they had an 
agreement. Electro says that he will get rid of the ninjas that the Black 
Tarantula is using to harass the Rose with, but says that he is like a god now 
and wonders if it isn’t like using a nuclear bomb to swat flies. Later Electro 
manipulates the electrical field to fly to where the Black Tarantula’s ninjas 
have been seen. Spider-Man is facing off against Dragonfly, who was sent to kill 
Robbie Robertson by the Black Tarantula, when a bolt of lightning strikes down. 
Spider-Man dodges, but Dragonfly is caught in the blast. Spider-Man sees Electro 
and says that he thought he had retired. Electro says that he is back, and more 
powerful than ever. Electro says that Spider-Man will never humiliate him again. 
Spider-Man asks what happened to him being thankful that he saved Electro’s 
life. Electro starts to answer Spidey, but then remembers why he went there. 
Electro blasts the ninjas. Electro tries to hit Dragonfly again, but she dodges 
out of the way. Dragonfly tries to kick Electro, but as soon as she enters his 
personal space his electric field blasts her into unconsciousness. Electro says 
that she is lucky he didn’t kill her. Electro turns his attention back to 
Spider-Man. Spider-Man tries to shoot webbing at Electro, butt he heat from his 
electricity melts it before it reaches him. Spidey tries the old fire hydrant 
trick, but Electro heats up the water so fast that it turns to steam. Electro 
says that Spider-Man must be punished for that corny trick. Electro disrupts the 
electric impulses to Spider-Man’s brain. Spider-Man screams in pain. Electro 
asks how it feels to be small and insignificant. Electro says that he could 
flash fry everything within a ten-block radius if he wanted to, but instead as 
payback for all the times Spider-Man beat him he wants to hear Spider-Man beg. 
Spider-Man begs, but Electro says that he can’t hear him. Spider-Man begs louder 
and asks if Electro is satisfied. Electro says that was perfect and flies away.

car. He is supposed to break it apart and take the cash to help out the Rose’s 
depleted funds. Electro blows the truck to pieces and fries all the money 
inside. He is still having troubles with control. Later Electro sits in an 
abandoned power station, his new secret headquarters, that the Rose purchased 
for him. Rose tells Electro that there can be no more screw-ups as he went to a 
lot of trouble and money to buy the station for him. Electro says no problem, 
but then asks when his jacuzzi and big screen television will be arriving. Later 
Electro catches a rat in his hideout. He fries the rat. Electro says that he has 
the power of a god, but says he wishes he had the imagination of one. He can’t 
think of a new crime worthy of his power level. He says that he is tired of 
being treated like dumb muscle by Rose and Delilah. Electro says that he is a 
contender now. He thinks of his father, wife, and mother. He says that he won’t 
take anymore. He screams, “No more” as he releases a major power burst and 
destroys his new secret headquarters. Rose decides that he has to dump Electro. 
The Rose sends information about Electro’s whereabouts to Spider-Man. Spider-Man 
arrives, in an insulated suit with insulated webbing, with Nate Gray at the 
Central Switching Generator. The Central Switching Generator controls all the 
energy flow through all five boroughs of New York. Electro has paralyzed the 
workers there, but says that they will recover in time to evacuate with the rest 
of the city. Electro asks if he is supposed to be intimidated because he is in 
an insulated suit and brought his Leonardo DiCaprio wannabe friend with him. 
Electro says he assumes that Delilah ratted him out. Nate Gray zaps Electro. He 
says that he is just going to place some mental blocks to prevent Electro from 
using his full power. Electro says that it sounds like a good plan, but brain 
waves are electrical and he controls electricity. Electro charges into Nate 
Gray. They blast right out of the generator area back to the street’s surface. 
Nate is left stunned. Spider-Man kicks Electro from behind as he is about to 
barbeque Nate. Electro laughs. He gives Spidey credit for making contact. 
Electro wipes the blood from his nose and it sizzles as it hits the ground. 
Spider-Man mentions that he saved Electro’s life. Electro says that is a very 
sore subject. He blasts at Spider-Man, but Spidey dodges. Electro flies after 
Spider-Man blasting up the entire neighborhood as he goes. Spidey webs up 
Electro in his conductive webbing. Electro blasts it off destroying a building 
and injuring Spider-Man. Spider-Man throws a rock at Electro, and for some 
unknown reason it hits. Electro falls to the ground. Spider-Man starts to wail 
on Electro. Spider-Man says that it is his responsible for bringing Electro 
down. Electro says that he is just like his father, bringing him down. Electro 
blasts Spider-Man. He flies off saying that he will prove that he isn’t a 
failure. Electro says that he was just going to destroy a few evacuated city 
blocks, but now he is going to destroy all the five boroughs…even if he goes 
down too. Spidey leaps into Electro causing him to miss his target, but Electro 
just smacks him away. Spidey leaps back up into Electro. He hits him so hard he 
blocks the release of energy. Electro and Spidey start to fall. Nate Gray 
catches Spider-Man, but Electro falls. Spider-Man shoots him a webline to hang 
onto. Electro says that he won’t go back to prison and suffer the humiliation. 
He zaps the web line and falls to the water below. A giant release of

Electro sits in a chair. He is at one with the electrical field around him and 
can sense when something disturbs it. Electro unleashes a large amount of power 
upon Sandman as he approaches. Sandman identifies himself, and Electro tells him 
to go away. Sandman says that he wants to get the Sinister Six back together 
again. Electro blasts Sandman and says that he told him to go away. Sandman says 
that they are going to make a lot of money and kill Doctor Octopus. Electro says 
one word…”yes”. Later Spider-Man is trying to talk Arthur Stacy into not killing 
Senator Ward (who is currently standing with Doctor Octopus) when he sees Kraven 
and a group of ninjas. Spidey goes after him to find the Vulture stalking him. 
Spider-Man tries to punch an illusion of a vulture. Electro blasts Spider-Man 
with a bolt. As Mysterio, Kraven, Sandman, and Vulture deal with Spider-Man, 
Electro blasts Doc Ock. Doctor Octopus grabs Spider-Man and says that he needs 
his help. Ock throws Spider-Man to Venom.</FONT></P>

Sandman says that they don’t want a fight with him. Doc Ock and Ward disappear 
in the smoke and confusion. Arthur Stacy saves Spider-Man with a firebomb. After 
Spidey gets away Sandman puts the fire out for Venom. The Sinister Six make fun 
of Venom for being such a sissy about fire. Sandman and Venom start to mix it 
up, but Electro blasts them apart. Mysterio says that they have a job to do. 
Mysterio offers to let Venom help them. Venom says that they can kill Ward and 
Doc Ock, but Spider-Man is his. Kraven says that he hit Doc Ock with a drugged 
spear. The Sinister Six starts chasing them. Sandman says that he doesn’t trust 
Mysterio or Electro, but that Kraven has honor and he and Vulture have an 
understanding. They catch up with Ock, Ward, and Spider-Man as Spidey stops 
Stacy from killing Ward again. Sandman says that Ward is with them, Ock dies, 
and that Spider-Man can leave with the old man. Venom freaks so Sandman smashes 
him against the wall. Electro zaps out energy as the others go after him. 
Sandman fights with Venom. Suddenly Senator Ward starts to burst with power. He 
is some type of alien. The Sinister Six are hit by the energy. Mysterio signals 
Electro, and Electro releases a huge amount of energy matching Ward’s. Ward 
disappears and Electro and the Sinister Six run for it, as does Doc Ock. A short

is seeing. A real bolt of lightning strikes the ground after being shot out by 
“Mysterio’s whippin’ dog Electro”. Electro starts to unleash the power. Electro 
says that Spider-Man made a big mistake following Sandman there. Mysterio also

to Sandman. Electro says that Sandman was weak and got what he deserved. Electro 
tells Mysterio to give him the word and he will kill Venom. Mysterio tells him 
to do that as he leaves. Suddenly Venom jumps Electro from behind and starts 
pounding on him. For some unknown reason the huge amounts of electricity coming 
off Electro doesn’t bother Venom at all. Electro does nothing to defend himself 
with his “new and improved” powers. Venom seems to think Electro dead when he
