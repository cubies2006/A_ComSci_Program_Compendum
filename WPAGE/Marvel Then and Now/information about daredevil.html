    Matt Murdock was the son of 'Battling Jack' Murdock, a boxer who made his 
    living in New York's Hell's Kitchen. Raising Matt alone, due to the death of 
    Matt's mother, the elder Murdock took it upon himself to provide a better 
    life for his son. He began to work as an enforcer for the Fixer, a local 
    mobster, to give Matt more than his boxing winnings. However, Jack Murdock 
    taught his son not to fight and tried to guide him into studies. Matt became 
    a bookworm, and repeatedly was mocked by students. They teased him by 
    calling him 'Daredevil'. Matt didn't want to get his father mad at him, so 
    he secretly trained himself, so he could stand up to the bullies at school.</span></p>

    While walking down a street one day, Matt noticed a blind man was about to 
    get hit by a truck. He ran in front of the truck, and pushed the blind man 
    out of the way. However, the truck was carrying radioactive waste, and some 
    spilled out directly onto Matt's eyes. Matt couldn't see anymore.</span></p>

    Matt's remaining senses became heightened, and he was able to 'see' using a 
    'radar' sense, that showed outlines and shapes. His hearing became so acute 
    that he could hear heartbeats. He could smell the faintest odor in a room. 
    He could touch a newspaper to 'read' it.</span></p>

    <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #FFFFFF; font-weight:700">After

    During this time, Jack Murdock was enjoying some success in the boxing ring. 
    However, he soon found out that all his matches were fixed, and he was to 
    throw his next fight. Jack didn't want to lose his match in front of his son 
    in the audience, so he went against his orders and won the match. He was 
    murdered by the Fixer's men that night. Matt, using his new training and 
    abilities, sought revenge against his father's killers.</span></p>

    After a few years, Matt went to Columbia University and studied law with his 
    friend Franklin 'Foggy' Nelson. It was here that both men received their 
    degrees, and they started up their law firm 'Nelson and Murdock' in New York 
    City afterwards. Karen Page was their secretary. Matt adopted the identity 
    of Daredevil to begin his crusade against all the injustices he saw in the 
    courtroom. The major villains he has had to contend with are the Kingpin, 
    Bullseye, the Hand, Mr. Fear, Cobra, Mr. Hyde, Stilt-Man and others.</span></p>
