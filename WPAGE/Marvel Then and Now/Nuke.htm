align=left>Agent Simpson was part success and part failure. The government 
wanted to create a new super soldier. They were only moderately successful. Nuke 
was certainly a powerful and devoted soldier, however he was also quite insane. 
Nuke was augmented and he also liked to supplement his strength with red, white, 
and blue pills that boosted his adrenaline. The madness was also an advantage 
because Nuke generally didn't question his sometimes somewhat illegal 
orders.</P>

Nuke asks for a red pill on his way to his next mission. The Colonel flying the 
helicopter he rides in tries to explain, probably not for the first time, that 
he isn't in Vietnam looking for MIA's, but rather in Nicaragua. Nuke resets the 
kill counter on "Betsy" from 162 to 000, and promises he will break that number 
for the Colonel. Nuke says that they are holding "our boys" as he pulls on his 
gas mask. The red pill starts to work as Nuke leaps from the helicopter. He 
starts by firing napalm at the tower. Betsy's kill counter reads 005. The red is 
working full blast now as the adrenaline rushes in. Nuke fires, and Betsy reads 
032. Nuke dodges bullets, and blows up a jeep. Betsy reads 045. Nukes says, "Our 
boys" as he continues to fire. Betsy reads 088 as Nuke goes totally red. Later, 
Nuke asks for a white, and asks where he is going now. The Colonel says that the 
General is sending him to New York. Betsy reads 197. Elsewhere the General 
contacts Kingpin and tells him that Nuke, Agent Simpson, is on his way, and that 
he awaits the goods Fisk promised him. On the plane over Nuke asks for a blue. 
The fight attendant comes to tell Nuke that the beer he asked for isn't made 
anymore. She offers him a substitute. Nuke grabs the beer and her wrist. He 
demands to know where the beer is brewed. She tells him Milwaukee. The Colonel 
tells him not to worry it's an American beer. Finally Nuke stands before 
Kingpin. Kingpin tells Nuke that his predecessor, the first super-soldier, had 
in much easier. That these are trying times when patriots are laughed at. 
Kingpin says Nuke reminds him of his son, also a veteran. Kingpin says that he 
is persecuted as a criminal. Kingpin says that legislation threatens free 
enterprise. He says that he and a few like minded allies have united against 
those unpatriotic ones that are trying to tear down. Kingpin says that one man 
threatens to destroy what they have built with his friends in the press. Nuke 
asks where he is. Kingpin sends him to Hell's Kitchen. The Colonel drops Nuke 
off low. He tells him to skip the Napalm because these are Americans. Daredevil 
hears from four blocks away a baby's lung collapsing from Nuke's gunfire. Nuke 
moves up on the helicopter. They're being shot at by another copter. Nuke 
destroys it. Just then a billy club bounces off Nuke's temple, and back to 
Daredevil. Nuke asks for a red.</FONT> </P>

width=252 align=left></FONT><FONT size=2>Daredevil #233- A water tower explodes 
as Nuke shoots at Daredevil. When Daredevil is out of sight the Colonel tries to 
abort the mission, but Nuke leaps from the copter saying, "Won't let you 
down…won't let…our boys down". Daredevil hears people dying everytime Nuke fires 
his gun. He kicks nukes face, but Nuke is faster than he is and he hits 
Daredevil with the butt of his gun. The Colonel shoots at Daredevil from the 
copter. Daredevil tries for a nerve center, but it doesn't affect Nuke. Nuke 
brings the gun down on the back of Daredevil's head. Daredevil pokes Nuke's 
eyes, but he doesn't feel the pain. Again Daredevil is introduced to Nuke's gun. 
Daredevil tries to sever a muscle, but nearly breaks his fingers on Nuke's 
forearm. Daredevil punches the elbow, but is rewarded with a backhand in the 
face. Daredevil kicks him off the top of the building into some power lines. 
Nuke falls onto an on fire police car. Nuke fires up, but Daredevil leaps onto 
him and knocks him through the roof. Daredevil takes Nuke's gun and rolls off as 
the car explodes. Nuke emerges on fire with a knife. Daredevil breaks of the 
butt of the gun on Nuke's face. The Colonel starts to shoot, but Daredevil blows 
up the helicopter with Nuke's gun. The Avengers arrive. Daredevil has Nuke by 
the throat yelling that he wants to hear that it was Kingpin that sent him. Nuke 
just keeps asking for a white. The Avengers take Nuke into custody. As Nuke begs 
for a white Captain America looks dejectedly downward. The General is taking to 
the Kingpin as Captain America barges in. The General says Cap isn't cleared for 
information. Cap doesn't leave, but breaks into the sub-level six, the Vault. 
Cap finds out about Agent Simpson and the super soldier info. Nuke is shouting 
for a red, but can't have one right now because of how jumpy the reds make him. 
The General says that Nuke is being shipped off against the enemy. Nuke says 
that the enemy is here. He grabs the newspaper and says, "This is the 
enemy…this..they lie about us…make us feel ashamed". He grabs a guard's gun and 
shoots everyone in the room killing them all but the General. He breaks off his 
handcuffs, and reaches for the reds. Nuke takes the whole bottle and says, "I 
won't let you down, sir…They try…to make our boys ashamed". Cap goes up when he 
hears the siren. Nuke pushes some soldiers down taking a rifle. His last shot 
bounces off Cap's shield. Cap pushes him through the outside wall. They fall 
through the building next door. Cap struggles up, and picks up Nuke. When Cap 
comes through the roof the helicopter shoot at them. Daredevil pushes the over. 
Daredevil tries to move Nuke, but another helicopter shoots him up. Cap stops 
the other soldiers as Daredevil tries to drive Nuke to a hospital. Nuke doesn't 
want to go. Daredevil takes Nuke to the Daily Planet and puts Nuke's dead body 
on Ben Urich's desk. While the Kingpin isn't ever charged with anything it does 
cause him to be shunned by the legitimate business world.</FONT> </P>
