<B>Members:</B> Arachne (Dr Sylvie Yaqua), Therak (Theo), and Antro (Hashi 
Noto)<BR><B>First Appearance:</B> Avengers West Coast 82<BR><B>What's Their 
Problem?</B> Well, basically, they die if they don't do as their boss the 
Manipulator tells them. When they became super-human beings based on rare 
chemicals and spider venoms their injections were spiked so that they must 
recieve a regular treatment of an antidote.
<P><B>Abilities:</B> 
<UL><B>Arachne</B>: Arachne is capable of physically generating webbing and 
  neuro-toxins from glands in her wrists</UL>
<UL><B>Antro</B>: Capable of "trapdooring" originally himself and others near 
  him, he can now teleport objects from a distance as well.</UL>
<UL><B>Therak</B>: This guy is strong. Very strong. I mean, strong. He messed 
  with Wonder Man and won. Of course the fact that he has six arms and is 
  extremely large helped. Oh yes, and he has pretty tough skin 
too.</UL><BR><B>Weapons:</B> All three members of Death-Web use an artificial 
venom as a weapon. This lethal venom causes swelling, bloating and 
discolouration of the skin.
<P><B>Favorite Quote:</B> 
<UL><B>Antro</B>: "The name Avengers -- is <B>DEATHWEB</B>" (Avengers West 
  Coast 84)</UL>
<UL><B>Arachne</B>: "As Antro told you, fools -- The name is Death-Web!" 
  (Avengers West Coast 85)</UL>
<UL><B>Therak</B>: "You -- beat Therak? That's a laugh!" (Avengers West Coast 
  85)</UL><BR><B>Heroes They Keeps Running Into:</B> While they first threw down 
with the Avengers West Coast (aided by Spider-Man) their main interest is 
actually Spider-Woman, whom they messed with one too many times.<BR><BR>

<P><B>People Who Think They're Not So Bad:</B> Well, even the Manipulator who 
used them as his lackies didn't like them very much. And they certainly didn't 
like each other tons.<BR><B>Most Despicable Act:</B> Holding Spider-Woman's 
daughter as a hostage to coerce her into killing Spider-Man and then joining 
them. And then doing pretty much the same thing again!<BR>
