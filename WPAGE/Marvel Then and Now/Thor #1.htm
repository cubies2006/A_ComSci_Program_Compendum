      <P>It was a normal morning in New York; people were all going about their 
      business without a care in the world. They crammed themselves into the 
      subways and jammed their cars into the highways. They walked on the 
      sidewalks without any space to move. They fired guns at each other and 
      took over buses. In this case, they took over a bus with children and 
      seniors. Five gunmen to be exact. They were killers without thought, 
      trained by the best by some foreign group. In fact, they held the entire 
      NYPD down without a single wound. They were power.</P>
      <P>"O'Neal, got any ID on the terrorists?" It was Detective Johnson who 
      was trying to avoid getting shot. They weren't firing back for obvious 
      reasons.</P>
      <P>"No, not any, we haven't even seen a picture of these guys." O'Neal was 
      sweating. "Hope one of those Avenge-." He was cut off by gust of wind and 
      everyone looked up. There stood a tall muscular figure staring at the 
      bus.</P>
      <P>"If thou harms the occupants of the bus, thou shalt ne'er see daylight 
      again!" His tone was serious and angry. "If'n ye shoot at yon people 
      without a thought, thou shalt be punished!"</P>
      <P>He swung his hammer at the bus with dead accuracy of a window that 
      everyone could see a man behind. It hit the man and the hammer went to hit 
      the other five. The hammer came back as everyone on the bus ran out scared 
      out of their minds. The man grabbed the hammer and came down to 
O'Neal.</P>
      <P>"Thanks Thor. Thanks a lot" O'Neal was nervous and always thought Thor 
      was a big farce. Thor called himself the Thunder God of Asgard. Who would 
      believe that?</P>
      <P>"Thou is welcome, but thee seemeth to be uncomfortable." </P>
      <P>"It's nothing." O'Neal said as he itched the back of his head. "Just my 
      injury hurts a little." O'Neal had been injured in the attack of the 
      Enchanter named Entrakt.*</P>
      <P>[* Check out Marvel's <I>Thor </I>#18--Dino]</P>
      <P>"Ah yes, I hath forgotten bout that. I give all my hopes you get 
      better." Thor said with deep sincerity.</P>
      <P>"Uh... thanks," O'Neal said as he watched Thor fly off into the sky. 
      "Weirdo" He mumbled under his breath.</P>
      <P>Thor flew over to a back alley not knowing where to go. He decided to 
      head over to the home of Jane Foster, a friend of his, more before. He 
      finally arrived and hit his hammer on the ground. There was an instant 
      flash of light and where Thor stood, stood a short skinny man. Jake Olson, 
      paramedic and wanted by the authorities for illegal drug handling.</P>
      <P>Jake went into the building and knocked on the apartment door, hoping 
      she hadn't gone to work yet. She opened the door, munching on a bagel in 
      her robe. "Jake..Thor, hi." She was surprised to see him because of the 
      way everyone was after him. Also, she was one of the only people on Earth 
      who knew Thor was Jake. "Come inside quick. Would you like something to 
      eat?"</P>
      <P>"No thank you, but I need a place to stay, and the cops are all over my 
      place. I know this is a lot to ask, but can I stay here?"</P>
      <P>"I don't know, what would my husband say." She thought for a moment and 
      said, "Oh all right, you saved my life so many times, guess it's time to 
      pay back." Jake said thanks and went into the bathroom. Jane thought to 
      herself, what was she going to do with a framed wanted thief?</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, in a distant dimension, a dark man sat thinking. He wore 
      green all over and had a helmet with horns sticking out. He was talking to 
      freakish monster looking thing. "Is your being ready?"</P>
      <P>"Oh yes Loki, it is, and it will annihilate your stepbrother in a 
      matter of minutes."</P>
      <P>"I would hope so. if Thor lives, thy reputation would suffer, thou 
      knowest that?"</P>
      <P>"Ha Ha, of course I know that. But I have one question for you 
Loki"</P>
      <P>"What is thy question."</P>
      <P>"Why must you talk in that horrible accent."</P>
      <P>"Thy humor does not humor me Mephisto, ruler of the underworld. Verily, 
      thou plan must succeed!"</P>
      <HR SIZE=5>

      <P>Thor had already left Dr. Foster's house and was on his regular patrol 
      of New York, to see if anything was wrong. He was thinking about recent 
      events, on how his people of Asgard had disappeared, and reappeared. The 
      felt that it was wrong and that something stranger was happening on 
      Asgard. Thor did not understand conspiracies well, so he didn't care about 
      it much.</P>
      <P>Anyway, as he was flying, he heard a deep rumbling sound.</P>
      <P><I>Eh..What manner of trickery is this?</I> he thought to himself. He 
      flew over to investigate and saw a being that he never saw before. It was 
      different; it stood around 10 feet tall. It had six arms and sort of 
      hunched over a bit. It wore just some regular pants that looked like torn 
      jeans. It was causing such mayhem that the docks were being tore apart. 
      The docks... Thor had died there once,* but that was a long story.</P>
      <P>[* In Marvel's <I>Thor</I> #1-2--Dino]</P>
      <P>He flew down to the ground and asked, "What is thou to be causing such 
      destruction in the world of Midgard?" The creature didn't answer and Thor 
      knew that this was going to be a silent fight.</P>
      <P>Thor swung his arm in a circular motion and threw it into the odd 
      creature. Mjolnir, Thor's hammer, just bounced off. The hammer flew back 
      to Thor, due to its mystical enchantment. The creature looked up and 
      opened its mouth. A little bit off smoke came out and then a giant 
      fireball the size of a car flew out. Thor was surprised at how a giant 
      fireball could come out of a small mouth. It hit Thor before he could move 
      and Thor went flying to the ground scorched terribly.</P>
      <P>He got up with pain and shouted, "Thou must do better than that, foul 
      miscreant!" Anyone near him could sense his anger, but no one was there. 
      Thor flew into the air and put the hammer in front of him. Dark clouds 
      started surrounding Thor as lightening bolts flew out of the hammer. They 
      all went flying toward the creature, but it moved out of the way with such 
      speed and grace, it took Thor by surprise.</P>
      <P>How could a creature like that move like that? The creature started 
      running and flew into the air. It hit Thor which such power, Thor was 
      surprised, yet hit again. The flung Thor to the ground hard! BAM!</P>
      <P>The creature then landed on Thor's stomach, crushing a few bones. It 
      then proceeded to pound Thor with it's fists and there where a few flashes 
      of orange light. The creature stepped back a few feet and looked at Thor. 
      Thor had been scorched horribly and beyond recognition. The creature 
      roared in triumph, since it had defeated Thor.</P>
      <P>Or so he thought. Thor lifted his hammer, but it then fell on his 
      stomach, as he passed out.</P></TD></TR></FONT></TBODY></TABLE><IMG height=1
