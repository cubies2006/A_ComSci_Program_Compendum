      stayed with the comic for its first year, relinquishing art chores to Don 
      Heck with the September, 1964 issue, but did occasional page layouts 
      during its second year. Lee stayed on a while longer. In the years 
      following, the series has been written by Roy Thomas, Steve Englehart, 
      Kurt Busiek, and many other top comics writers; and drawn by such stellar 
      artists as George Pérez, John Buscema and Neal Adams. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><b><font color="#33CCCC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hulk 
      — not exactly a team player — quit in issue #2. In the fourth issue, 
      Captain America, freshly revived from a state of suspended animation he'd 
      entered during the closing days of World War II, joined. Seven issues 
      after that, Spider-Man became the first superhero to be offered 
      membership, and turn it down. By this time, the group was firmly ensconced 
      in its first headquarters, a Manhattan mansion owned by Tony Stark (Iron 
      Man's secret identity) and staffed by Edwin Jarvis, the butler who was to 
      remain a supporting character for many years to come. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><b><font color="#33CCCC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 16th 
      issue (May, 1965) contained the first of many total upheavals in 
      membership. All of the charter members resigned, leaving only Captain 
      America. Their places were taken by three reformed super-villains, seeking 
      a chance to atone for their misdeeds. Hawkeye, a super-bowman reminiscent 
      of DC's Green Arrow, had formerly plagued Iron Man. Quicksilver and The 
      Scarlet Witch, brother and sister, were fleeing the Brotherhood of Evil 
      Mutants, a group of X-Men bad guys. All three were to remain with The 
      Avengers for years to come. (The reason for jettisoning the most popular 
      characters probably had to do with distribution limitations — Marvel was 
      limited in how many comics per month it could publish, and it was 
      apparently decided that keeping minor characters in the public eye was a 
      better use of one of them, than featuring those that appeared regularly 
      elsewhere.) </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><b><font color="#33CCCC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of 
      the founders (except, of course, The Hulk) eventually came back (after 
      Marvel overcame its distribution problem, in 1968), and most have drifted 
      in and out ever since. Others who have been Avengers members over the 
      years include (but are by no means limited to) The Beast, The Vision, 
      Wonder Man, Hercules, </font>
      <a href="http://www.toonopedia.com/tigra.htm"><font color="#33CCCC">Tigra,</font></a><font color="#33CCCC"> 
      Starfox, The Sub-Mariner, She-Hulk, Patsy Walker, The Black Knight … The 
      list goes on and on. Even The Two-Gun Kid became one of their reservists 
      for a time. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><b><font color="#33CCCC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 1985, 
      the group had become so large (even with most members inactive at any 
      given time), that some of its members were spun off into a second series — 
      West Coast Avengers. Hawkeye set up a branch headquarters in Los Angeles, 
      and several of the ongoing characters followed him into a new monthly 
      comic, which lasted until 1994. A third group, calling itself Great Lakes 
      Avengers, never quite got off the ground, nor was it ever officially 
      recognized by the parent group. </font></b></p>
      <p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20"><b><font color="#33CCCC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Surprisingly, it took until 1999 for The Avengers to appear on TV — or in 
      any non-comics story media, beyond a paperback novelization or two. That 
      was the year an animated <i>Avengers</i> series joined <i>X-Men</i> and <i>
      Spider-Man</i> on Fox TV's Saturday morning lineup. Results are not yet 
      in, but as popular as those other recent Marvel shows have been, it seems 
      likely Marvel's most all-encompassing group has finally found its place on 
      the air. </font></b></p>
