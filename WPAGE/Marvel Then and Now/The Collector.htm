<H1>The Collector</H1></CENTER><B>Real name:</B> Taneleer Tivan<BR><B>First 
appearance: </B>Avengers 28<BR><B>Died in: </B>Avengers 174<BR><B>Got Better 
In:</B> Marvel Super-Heroes Contest of Champions 3<BR><B>What's His Problem?</B> 
The Collector is an Elder of the Universe, one of a handful of beings who have 
lived since shortly after the Big Bang and are the last known survivors of their 
respective races.. The Elders sustain their lives through their monomaniacal 
obsessions with certain things -- in Tivan's case, collecting. He has been 
repeatedly frustrated in his attempts to add the Avengers, Earth's greatest 
super-heroes, to his collection.<BR><B>Abilities:</B> As an Elder, Tivan has a 
potentially indefinite life span so long as he sustains the will to live. The 
Collector, like most Elders, also has the ill-defined ability to manipulate 
"cosmic energy" for a variety of effects, such as matter restructuring, 
concussive force and energy constructs. An ability unique to the Collector is 
his power of prophecy, allowing him to foresee potential disasters. The 
Collector originally appeared in the form of a frail, elderly humanoid but is 
capable of assuming a more alien (and more physically powerful) guise which is 
apparently his true form.<BR><B>Weapons:</B> The Collector owns a near-infinite 
variety of earthly and alien weapons, devices and living creatures that comprise 
an unlimited arsenal at his disposal. Notable items include the Temporal 
Assimilator, which allows time travel, a cloak of levitation and exotic 
teleportation technology. He once used the latter device to covertly beam almost 
all of the past and present Avengers into his specimen tubes over a period of 
days before the remaining heroes realized what was happening and confronted 
him.<BR><B>Favorite Quote:</B> "There is no dishonour in accepting the 
inevitable! Submit! It would be a shame if I accidentally damaged you beyond 
repair while subduing you!" (Avengers 174. An exasperated Collector's plea to a 
defiant Hawkeye after "subduing" all of the other Avengers. Against all odds, 
Hawkeye cleaned the pompous old cosmic duffer's clock.)<BR><B>Heroes He Kept 
Running Into: </B>The Collector has tried to collect the Avengers many times 
over, always without success (given the humble state of my back issues, I know 
how he feels).<BR><B>People Who Think He's Not So Bad: </B>Collector's wife 
Matani and daughter Carina liked 'im well enough, but Matani lacked her hubby's 
drive and finally just up and died. As for Carina, Tivan used her as curvaceous 
bait to entice the potential cosmic conqueror <A 
href="http://www.geocities.com/marvel_villain/kovac/korvac.html">Korvac</A>, a 
plan that went awry when she fell in love with Korvac and ditched her pop (she 
did cry when Korvac blasted daddy dearest to dust, though). Collector's only 
other friends are his fellow Elders, most notably the Grandmaster, who once 
forfeited his life to resurrect the Collector in a game with Death.<BR><B>Most 
Despicable Act: </B>The Collector's finest hour would be the storyline 
concluding in Avengers 174, where he succeeded in covertly abducting more 
Avengers than ever before or since. However, his most truly despicable act would 
be his employment of the alien Brethren race as an unwitting biological weapon 
with which he intended to devastate the Earth, salvaging the few survivors for 
his collection (thereby ensuring their uniqueness). The scheme backfired when 
Avengers member Sersi turned the Brethern against him.<BR>
