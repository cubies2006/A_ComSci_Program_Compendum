super-villainy. Rhino has had several motivations since his change. First was 
simply as a work for hire muscle man, or to show his power. Then after being 
stuck within his suit for a bit Rhino decided that he wanted out. But escaping 
takes money, money to remove the Rhino suit that was bonded to him. Once he 
suceeded in getting out of his suit he realized the danger around him of being 
normal. So back in the suit. Rhino is now working to get money to get his family 
out of eastern Europe, and to show his power. Some things never change</font></b></P>
