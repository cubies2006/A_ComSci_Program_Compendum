    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">The burst of creativity that led to 
    the modern Marvel Comics began in 1961. A torrent of ideas seemed to rush 
    through the pages of the company's publications as the concept of the super 
    hero was reworked and revised, reshaped and revitalized. Ultimately, a 
    veritable renaissance was achieved. A virtual army of new characters sprang 
    up in the 1960's and became giants in the field; their combined strength 
    turned a moribund industry around. With characteristic hyperbole, but also 
    considerable accuracy, editor Stan Lee dubbed this period &quot;The Marvel Age of 
    Comics.&quot; In fact, the term has been adopted by comic book fans all over the 
    world and is still used today to describe the 1960's.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">In creating The Fantastic Four and 
    the ground breaking books that followed it, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby 
    established that the personalities of the heros rather than the plots, 
    should be of paramount importance. The Fantastic Four acquired their amazing 
    powers after their experimental rocket passed through a storm of cosmic 
    rays. The Fantastic Four dazzled readers with their oddball personalities, 
    but the manner in which they were brought to life was even more of a break 
    through. Most comic books had been created from scripts prepared by writers 
    and editors. The words came first, and usually the artists were given 
    instructions on how to divide the stories into pages and panels. With an 
    accomplished professional like Jack Kirby, Lee knew that he would receive 
    powerful pages even if he gave the artist nothing more than a synopsis, 
    which was all he provided for the first issue of Fantastic Four. When the 
    drawing came back Lee added dialogue and captions. The results were so 
    splendid that Kirby and Lee never worked any other way again.</font></p>

    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">For their second super hero, Lee 
    and Kirby came up with another monstrous figure, who was inspired by the 
    success of The Thing, and also by the comic books like Tales to Astonish. 
    The result was The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). The fear of radiation was a 
    theme that recurred throughout the early 1960's, and again, radiation was 
    the gimmick that provided The Hulk with his uncanny powers. The original 
    Hulk story depicted the first test of a new &quot;gamma bomb&quot; invented by a 
    scientist named Bruce Banner, who was exposed to the blast through the 
    machinations of a Communist spy working under the transparent alias &quot;Igor.&quot; 
    The spy was a throwback to bygone days; eventually such conventional devices 
    were abandoned in favor of more imaginative plot developments, but Igor was 
    tolerated because his presence served to turn Banner into the Hulk.</font></p>

    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">By 1962, Marvel was on a roll. The 
    little company was bursting at the seams, and was beginning to feel 
    constrained by the deal with DC that allowed only eight Marvel books to be 
    distributed per month. As a result, the next round of super heroes made 
    their first appearances not in new publications, but as features in the 
    already existing &quot;monster&quot; comics, which had now outlived their popularity. 
    In August 1962, The Mighty Thor took the stage in Journey Into Mystery #83. 
    A typically flawed modern Marvel hero, Dr. Don Blake walked with a limp and 
    used a cane until he discovered the long-lost hammer of the ancient god 
    Thor. Its power changed Blake into the virtually omnipotent Thor, complete 
    with armor, helmet and golden locks. In the early 1960's the super heroes 
    were popular, but they were coming out only once every two months. Lee had 
    enough time to work on the plots, but he turned the detailed scripting to 
    Thor over to his brother Larry Lieber. The results were good, but the tiny 
    Marvel crew was just too busy to give him the attention he deserved. More 
    effort was being expended on another new super hero, one who would 
    eventually become the company's best known creation, and ultimately its 
    informal corporate mascot as well.</font></p>

    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">The first Spider-Man story was 
    originally intended as no more than a one-shot experiment, and almost didn't 
    get into print at all. &quot;Martin Goodman didn't want to publish it&quot;, recalls 
    Stan Lee. Goodman was convinced that readers would find the subject of 
    spiders distasteful. Fortunately for all concerned, a comic book called 
    Amazing Adult Fantasy was about to be canceled due to faltering sales. For 
    the occation, the comic book reverted to ist original title of Amazing 
    Fantasy, an appropriate amendment since Spider-Man was to be the most 
    important adolescent super hero in comics.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="0" src="marvelhistory16.jpg" align="left" width="153" height="229">
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Spider-Man was the hero and the 
    teenage helper rolled into one; he was his own sidekick. Marvel's first 
    editor, Joe Simon, theorized that kid companions like Captain America's 
    Bucky were important because they gave the protagonist someone to talk to; 
    Spider-Man talked to himself. In his first apperence he mused aloud, but 
    subsequently Lee adopted the device of the thought balloon with its 
    characteristic bubbles. Spider-Man, despite the fact that he was not 
    originally intended to star in a series, became the epitome of the radical 
    innovations that characterized The Marvel Age. Lee used him to challenge the 
    very concept of the super hero. Spider-Man was neurotic, compulsive and 
    profoundly skeptical about the whole idea of becoming a costumed hero. The 
    Fantastic Four argued with each other, and the Hulk and Thor had problems 
    with their alter egos, but Spider-Man had to struggle with himself.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">In the origin story (August 1962), 
    Peter Parker is a bookish, bespectacled high school student, isolated and 
    unpopular. He lives with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. While attending a 
    science exhibit, Peter is bitten by a spider that has accidentally received 
    a dose of radioactivity. As a result, Peter acquires the agility and 
    proportionate strength of an arachnid. This story, with its challenge to 
    comic book cliches, created an unexpected sensation. Months later Marvel got 
    the sales figures, and that issue of Amazing Fantasy was one of the best 
    selling Marvel ever had. However the usual months of creative and production 
    work leading to publication kept Amazing Spider-Man #1 from appearing until 
    March 1963.</font></p>

    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Seeming to pluck ideas out of the 
    air as major new characters appeared, Stan Lee showed something like vision 
    when he chose the country of Vietnam as the setting for the origin of Iron 
    Man (Tales of Suspense #39, March 1963). In 1963 comparatively few Americans 
    were intrested in Vietnam, but before long the war being waged there would 
    become the most crucial and controversial event of the 1960's. For Lee, the 
    setting may have been merely expedient, enabling him to introduce the 
    Communist villains he still employed with some regularity. Later, he had 
    second thoughts about his somewhat simplistic treatment of the Asian 
    nation's problems. Yet Ironman was a character whose very premise demanded 
    political intrigue.</font></p>
