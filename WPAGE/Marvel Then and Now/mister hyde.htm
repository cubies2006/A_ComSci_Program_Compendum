<img border="0" src="hyde1.gif" align="left" width="271" height="305">The main 
difference between Dr. Henry Jekyll and Dr. Calvin Zabo, who both transform into 
different versions of Mr. Hyde, is that Calvin Zabo was already a disreputable 
sort. He had been fired from every job he ever held. Zabo used the time on his 
hands to create a formula to let him emulate his favorite story, Dr. Jekyll and 
Mr. Hyde. Zabo wished to unleash the primitive forces of man's nature. Hyde is 
the type that revels in his evil. He loves being Hyde. </font></b> </P>
