<P align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>The Destroyer is an enchanted suit of armour in 
humunoid form which, when animated by the lifeforce of a sentient being, wielded 
vast powers which made it virtually invincible. It was composed of an unknown 
metal of Asgardian origin and was enchanted by Odin to be harder even than uru 
or adamantium and was therefore almost totally indestructible. Ordinarily the 
Destroyer stands at a height of 6 1/2 feet and weighss 850 pounds; however when 
it was animated by the combined life forces of all the gods of Asgard the 
Destroyer grew to a height of 2000 feet. No one can physically wear the 
Destroyer, nor can the Destroyer's armour be disassembled by any known means. 
Rather, one projects one's life force into the Destroyer's form, leaving his or 
her own body in a state of entranced paralysis. Usually, the transfer of life 
force was accomplished when a willing subject stands within arm's length of the 
Destroyer. Masters of mystical powers, such as Odin or Loki can accomplish the 
transfer over great distances. </FONT></STRONG></P>
