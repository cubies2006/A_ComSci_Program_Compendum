                Being the daughter of Chinese immigrants, she was named 
                Jubilation for the joy her people had felt upon coming to 
                America. Due to the father’s job as a bank director, the family 
                had a large income and they ended up living in Beverly Hills, 
                with young Jubilation entering prep school, where her talent for 
                gymnastics was discovered. However, Jubilation used her agility 
                for not so noble things, with her and her best friend spending 
                most of their time at the mall de jour, making petty robberies,
                <img src="jubilee01.jpg" align="right" width="475" height="205">making 
                their escape on their rollerblades. It wasn’t for the money, 
                just for the sake of doing it, or, as Jubilee put it, she wasn’t 
                proud of doing it, just of <i>how</i> they did it. One day, 
                though, Jubilee was trapped in a dead-end alley by a pair of 
                rent-a-cops. Fearing juvenile detention, not to mention her 
                parents‘ reaction, she panicked and her pyrotechnic powers 
                manifested, hitting full blast to destroy the entire alley. Her 
                first instinct was to run to the beach, where she tried to keep 
                her hands wet so that it would never happen again.

                Jubilee told her parents about her strange abilities, but it 
                didn’t seem to be a problem, as she soon learned how to control 
                it to a limited degree, keeping her powers from activating 
                without her realizing it.

                much later, though, the Lees were killed in what seemed to be a 
                car accident on Mulholland Drive. At the time, Jubilee had been 
                once more at the shopping mall with her friends. Arriving back 
                home, Jubilation found the police waiting for her to inform her 
                of the accident and she was handed over to another couple named 
                Lee from the neighborhood. Jubilee didn’t like it there and ran 
                away as soon as possible, returning to the mall, which now 
                seemed to be her only home. <font color="#ff00c0"><b>[Wolverine

                Jubilee stayed there for weeks, either living from stealing or 
                earning some money by performing with her fireworks. The 
                rent-a-cops, though, were annoyed by her constantly outrunning 
                them and eventually called in some mutant hunters, the M-Squad. 
                The same day the mall was visited by the female contingent of 
                the Australian X-Men group, Storm, Rogue, Dazzler and Psylocke. 
                Jubilee was the sole witness to their unique way of entrance, 
                through one of Gateway’s teleportation portals, and, admiring 
                the beautiful <center>

                <p>four ladies, she secretly followed them through the mall. 
                When the M-Squad attacked the young girl, they were easily 
                defeated by the X-Men, who then left the scene exactly the same 
                way they had arrived. Jubilee was intrigued by there being other 
                people with super-powers and, since Gateway deliberately left 
                the portal open long enough, for reasons known only to him, 
                Jubilee jumped through after them. <font color="#ff00c0"><b>

                <img src="jubilee04.jpg" align="right" width="350" height="320">Finding 
                herself in the middle of the Australian desert, Jubilee became 
                somewhat scared and wondered what the X-Men might do to her. 
                Therefore, she took up secretly living in the X-Men's base, an 
                abandoned town in the Australian Outback that had formerly been 
                used by the Reavers, scrounging food from the pantries and 
                making a small hidey-hole for herself to live in. Gateway was 
                the only one to know of her, but didn‘t alert the team to her 
                presence. She was almost exposed, when Nanny and the Orphan 
                Maker attacked the base and saw Jubilee, though in the confusion 
                of the battle she could slip away before any of the X-Men became 
                aware of her. <font color="#ff00c0"><b>[Uncanny X-Men Annual 
                #15, Uncanny X-Men #247-248]</b></font><br>

                <br>
                The X-Men might have found her soon enough but, almost 
                immediately after Jubilee arrived, the team began to dissolve, 
                some apparently dying and others leaving due
                <img src="jubilee05.jpg" align="left" width="354" height="350">to 
                personal matters. When the Reavers returned to reclaim their 
                base from the X-Men, the remaining members decided to use the 
                Siege Perilous as an escape route. Psylocke, Havok, Dazzler and 
                Colossus entered the magical doorway and were taken to new 
                lives, unaware of the secret houseguest they left behind. When 
                Wolverine returned from his brief leave of absence, he was taken 
                by surprise and the Reavers placed him on a cross and 
                &quot;crucified&quot; him in fire and blood. Jubilee was horrified by this 
                scenario but also wanted to help the strange man, and at night 
                she helped him to get free and took him to her hideout below the 
                city.<br>

                There, Jubilee tended to Logan’s wounds and also stayed by his 
                side when he became delusional. Critically wounded, Wolverine 
                was dragged through the desert by Jubilee until they reached 
                Sydney, where they then proceeded on a ship to the island of 
                Madripoor. <font color="#ff00c0"><b>[Uncanny X-Men #251-253]</b></font><br>

                Jubilee became something of a kid sidekick to Logan, looking 
                after him as his healing factor dealt with his wounds, and they 
                formed a father-daughter bond.
                <img src="jubilee07.jpg" align="left" width="442" height="250">When 
                they reached Madripoor, the partners met Lady Mandarin, who was 
                actually Psylocke brain-washed and in a new, Asian body. Jubilee 
                was captured by the Mandarin, Psylocke's controller, and dressed 
                up like a China doll. In desperation, Jubilation unleashed an 
                unprecedented amount of plasmoid power from her body, completely 
                demolishing the house she was in at the time. This incident made 
                Jubilee extremely wary in the future of ever pushing the limits 
                of her powers, as she was afraid of hurting people again.<br>

                Psylocke was eventually freed from the Mandarin's control when 
                she used her psychic knife on Wolverine, creating a psychic 
                backlash, as in his memories she saw herself how she was 
                supposed to be. Now a third member being added to their 
                traveling party, Jubilation was not immediately trusting of 
                Betsy and the two of them were heavily at odds for their first 
                few months together. However, for the sake of Wolverine, they 
                worked together and the trio shared several other adventures in 
                Madripoor. <font color="#ff00c0"><b>[Uncanny X-Men #257-258]</b></font><br>
