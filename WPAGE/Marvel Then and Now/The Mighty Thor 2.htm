align=left><B><FONT face=Arial><FONT color=#000000>Thor, who represents Marvel's 
deliberate effort to transend all other super heroes, is nothing less than a 
god. Writer Stan Lee worked with artist Jack&nbsp;Kirby to interpret an ancient 
legend through a new medium, but in the process they produced a concept that 
would gradually take on a meaning different from the original 
myth.</FONT></FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT face=Arial><FONT color=#000000>Thor's powers allow him to operate on 
a grandiose, cosmic scale, yet the old Norse tales that Marvel adapted\Ì×Odin, 
the virtually omnipotent leader of the legendary gods, is Thor's father, and he 
rules with an iron hand. Many comic book heroes are orphans, inspired to fight 
crime because of the death of their parents, so Thor's somewhat awkward position 
as a dutiful son sets him apart. None of this seemed especially significant when 
the series began in 1962, but over the years the relationship between father and 
son has developed some interesting twists.</FONT></FONT></B></P>
<P><IMG height=300 src="The Mighty Thor_files/thor.jpg" width=207 
align=right><B><FONT face=Arial><FONT color=#000000>The first Thor stories 
followed a common pattern of wish fulfillment. Frail Dr. Don Blake discovered 
Thor's magic hammer hidden in a cave, and used it to transform himself into a 
being of incalculable might. Over the years, however, Blake failed to develop as 
a character, and Thor took centerstage. Eventually it was revealed that Blake 
was a fraud with no real existence at all. Odin explained that years before he 
had punished his son Thor's arrogance by clouding his memory and placing his 
spirit in a mortal body. When "Blake" found the hammer and its power, he was 
only following his father's unspoken orders. Armed with this knowledge, Thor 
dropped the Blake persona, yet could not bring himself to abandon the human race 
that he had come to cherish. Marvel's reworking of Thor's story had taken on 
overtones of a more exalted ancient tale, one in which God sent his only son to 
earth to serve mankind.</FONT></FONT></B></P><!-- text below generated by server. PLEASE REMOVE --></OBJECT></LAYER>
