      was simply known as Spider-Man's clone...He was created by Miles Warren 
      (The Jackal) from Peter Parker's tissue sample he obtained years 
      earlier...Miles blamed Peter/ Spider-Man for the death of Gwen Stacy and 
      was intent on making his life a living nightmare...He did this by sending 
      a clone of him to fight him in Shea Stadium...An explosion apparently 
      killed the clone and Spider-Man disposed of the body in a smokestack at an 
      incinerating plant...After being tested by Dr. Curt Connors (The Lizard), 
      Spider-Man received the test results but threw away after being satisfied 
      that he was the real Peter Parker and never looked back or questioned the 
      situation again until...</FONT></STRONG> </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>

      Peter's Aunt May as her health conditions declined and when May went into 
      a hospital, the mystery man became so upset that he got on his motorcycle 
      and rode all the way to New York City to see her...Why did he care?...The 
      mystery man became less and less mysterious as he visited Peter Parker's 
      old school and his class ring he wore was a ring from the same 
      school...After dodging Peter at the hospital the first couple of times, 
      the mystery man met Peter Parker face to face and set off the wildest era 
      in the history of Spider-Man - The clone was back!</B></FONT> </P></TD>

      fighter...Since Spider-Man was obviously already taken, he went for 
      something pretty close, but with color: The Scarlet Spider!...The Scarlet 
      Spider continued for a while as a Pseudo-Spider-Man and worked with Spidey 
      quite a bit...He joined the New Warriors, a team of younger super-heroes 
      and he really did make a name for himself until a cybernetic version of 
      himself came on the scene and ruined his name...At the same time, the real 
      Spider-Man moved to Portland with his expecting wife Mary Jane so there 
      was a need for a Spider-Man. Who was better qualified than 
      Ben?</B></FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>

      by a then mysterious powerful man who wanted, even more than the Jackal, 
      to make Peter Parker's life a nightmare...The man would eventually show 
      his face and Spider-Man's greatest enemy has returned: The original Green 
      Goblin, Norman Osborn!...With Peter/ Spider-Man in the middle of a major 
      battle with the Goblin, Ben gave his life to save his "brother" Peter by 
      getting in the way of the Goblin's glider and became impaled with it...In
