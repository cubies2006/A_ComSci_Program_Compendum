Scientist decided that he needed a "volunteer" for one of his experiments. 
Twenty-four hours later he was transformed into M.O.D.O.K. After being freed 
from the alteration chamber M.O.D.O.K. killed his would be bosses and took over 
the leadership of AIM.</font></P>

the AIM scientists put him into the alteration chamber. He shouts that he did 
nothing wrong, but the scientist says that the Supreme One needs a volunteer. 
The Supreme One says that he is just another nameless agents of AIM, but when he 
has finished he will be a living breathing computer. He will become their 
greatest weapon. The next day the experiment is over. They dub him MODOK the 
Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing. MODOK’s head is monstrously large. He 
shouts, “What have you done to me?” The Supreme One says that he is now the most 
powerful brain on the planet. MODOK thinks to himself that he is more powerful 
than even they know. MODOK then killed the Supreme Scientist and took over as 
AIM’s leader</FONT></P>

manages to find the submarine that is AIM’s secret base. However they also spot 
him coming, and with an invention of theirs they capture Cap by filling his air 
supply up with gas. Cap wakes up bonded to a base plate that uses sheer magnetic 
force. One of the scientists says that MODOK welcomes him to the world of AIM 
reborn. AIM brings in the girl that Cap came to rescue, an agent of SHIELD. She 
is secretly wearing anti-polar coveralls so when she touches Cap he is freed of 
the magnetic force. Cap and the girl get away, but the girl says that she cannot 
leave until she learns about MODOK. They overhear some of the scientists fearing 
MODOK’s judgement. One says that they were the ones that created MODOK, and that 
he was supposed to be their ultimate weapon, yet now almost overnight they are 
under his leadership. The others tell him to be quiet or MODOK might hear. MODOK 
addresses the scientists. He says that there are still two invaders on the ship 
and that they must be captured. MODOK says that failure will result in death for 
all. AIM does recapture them, and the girl is brought before the screen that 
MODOK speaks through. MODOK orders her to walk onto a part of the floor. The 
girl’s will is no longer her own and she sinks into the part of the glowing

him, but they can hope Cap wins. They radio MODOK and ask him if he wishes to 
study Captain America before he is killed. MODOK says that he does. Cap phases 
through the platform he was being held on. Cap finds himself in another space, 
but at least he can move around. Cap gets up and looks around, but is stunned 
when he is hit by MODOK’s brain beam. Cap looks up to see MODOK floating next to 
the SHIELD girl. MODOK says that once he was nothing but a guinea pig for the 
scientists of AIM, but they did their job too well and now he is their master. 
The SHIELD agent warns Cap that MODOK’s brain is his weapon. She says that he 
can use it to control, fight, or destroy. MODOK says that he senses that he 
could never control either of them because they are both willing to die for what 
they believe in. MODOK says that he has no use for either of them. MODOK starts 
shooting mind beams at Cap. The first type blows Cap off his feet. The second is 
a stun shock beam. The third MODOK rips up the steel floor and launches pieces 
of it at Cap. MODOK sees that Cap’s shield is protecting him so he next uses a 
heat beam. AIM is watching the entire fight and decides that now is the time to 
rebel against MODOK. AIM fires upon MODOK and destroys his hover chair. MODOK 
says that he must not die like a helpless being. As Cap captures the AIM

correctly. He wants the Hulk to be taken out first. MODOK says that's fine, but 
only because it amuses him to help a soldier turn traitor. Abomination says he 
doesn't want to fight the Hulk again because it is too painful. MODOK uses his 
mind beam to raise Abomination out of the cryogenic pit. He says that his mind 
probe reveals that Abomination was beaten so badly last time that he now fears 
the Hulk. General Ross is ticked because he committed treason and Abomination 
won't follow through. MODOK says that is nonsense. He will "re-educate this 
coward to the ways of power". MODOK then mindblasts Ross so that it looks like 
he resisted him. MODOK laughs as he and Abomination fade from the base. Later, 
Modok tells the Abomination to get up and fight. Abomination says he doesn't 
want to be hurt again. Modok says that he will show Abomination the true meaning 
of pain. The room starts to attack Abomination. Abomination says he would rather 
die than feel that kind of pain again. MODOK says that the pain will never end 
until he fights. Abomination freaks and rips the room apart. He says he will 
fight anyone but the Hulk. Modok tells Abomination that things are different as 
Banner's mind controls the Hulk now. Modok says that he will cause the 
Abomination to grow stronger the more he fears MODOK.</FONT></P>

the base MODOK is in. Modok says that he has spent so much time with the 
Abomination that he didn't see this attack coming. Modok mindblasts the blue 
rogues yet he notices that a mind block is up preventing him from mind reading 
not only the rogues, but his own men. All AIM troops stand against him and start 
trying to kill him. AIM created Modok to work for it, not to rule it, and many 
feel that AIM has stagnated under his leadership. MODOK erects shields to 
protect himself from the blasters. He flies up high and blasts the rogues below. 
Modok thinks to himself that there might be too much firepower. He blasts a hole 
in the roof and flies out. Modok says he will return with the Abomination at his

Hulk and MODOK attack the base together. Hulk smashes AIM while MODOK kills them

MODOK blasts Hulk and demands an apology on his knees. Abomination tells Hulk to

his fate. MODOK shoots Abomination with a steady green beam that blasts his

He blasts Bushmaster’s arms off and escapes. He flies towards shore to complete

the island to his ultimate advantage. One of the AIM agents orders task forces 
seven and eight to fight them. MODOK says that this is no time to conserve

victory. Iron Man and Captain America find Zenith City. The people there have 
golden skin. One comes forward as the voice of the groupmind. There are no 
leaders because Zenith City is a perfect and free society. Iron Man says that it 
always was his dream. Cap asks about AIM soldiers, but the voice says that they 
have handled them. They are taken to the body of Dr. Mark Cushing where he lies 
in a tube. The voice says that Cushing was devastated when he discovered that 
his funding for creating paradise came from AIM. He died before giving them his 
secrets. They were hypnotized by AIM, but Iron Man and Cap’s interference has 
freed them. MODOK watches it all. A soldier tells MODOK that the task forces 
will be there in thirty-eight minutes. MODOK says that he doesn’t have that 
time, and doesn’t want them learning any more. He activates the override

Zenith City are under MODOK’s control and attacking Iron Man and Cap. The 
groupmind’s mental powers works well against them. Cap asks about taking out the

MODOK grabs Cap and says that he was always his first target from the first time

that MODOK has toyed with them long enough, and that they were prepared for

Alphans to see if they have any information on their project that Hudson and his 
synthetic duplicate did not. An agent tells MODOK that Wolverine has gained
