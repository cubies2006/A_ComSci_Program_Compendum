<P align="justify"><b><FONT face=Verdana>Eternity has been around since all of time! The first time 
any other being knew of him, must have been in Strange Tales #138. As the first 
force of reality, followed by Galactus, then Death, if anyone is strong enough 
to destroy any of these three beings, all life stops and cease. He is a Cosmic 
Entity like others. Galactus, Lord Chaos, Master Order, and Death are also 
Cosmic Entities. Later, he actually met Galactus, after a group of Elders tried 
to destroy Galactus. If it wasn't for Silver Surfer intervention, the Kree race 
would destroy Galactus, but Surfer obtained the Soul Gem and give it to the 
Elders. Later, Quasar comes in contact with Eternity, and searches for him, for 
the universe is in trouble, and must be due to his current status. So on 
Quasar's search, he meets many M-Bodies of Eternity, showing Eternity at many 
different times in his life, and on one occasion, trying to get the Living 
Tribunal, to have Adam Warlock give him back him cosmic powers, which he stole 
from Eternity. In the end, Quasar and his guide Tathki, an Elder, find Eternity 
unconscious, and is the cause of the Infinity War.</FONT></b></P>
