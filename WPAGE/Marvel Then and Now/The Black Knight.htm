<H1>The Black Knight</H1><B>Real Name:</B> Nathaniel Garrett<BR><B>First 
Appearance:</B> Tales to Astonish 52<BR><B>Died In:</B> Tales of Suspense 73, 
Avengers 47-48<BR><B>What's His Problem?</B> An eminent research scientist and 
university professor, Nathan Garrett was also a subversive espionage agent until 
his exposure and capture by Giant-Man (Henry Pym). Fleeing to his native 
Britain, Garrett learned he was a descendant of the heroic medieval Black 
Knight. The original Knight's spirit declared him unworthy of the Knight's ebony 
blade and denied him the Black Knight mantle. Deciding to spite his heroic 
heritage and turn his talents to crime, Garrett created some medieval-style 
weaponry and embarked on a criminal career in America as the villainous Black 
Knight.<BR><B>Abilities:</B> A brilliant geneticist, electrical engineer and 
weapons designer, Garrett designed and built the paraphernalia he used as the 
Black Knight. He also possessed considerable equestrian 
skills.<BR><B>Weapons:</B> Garrett carried a variety of exotic handguns, some of 
which could stun even Thor; one such gun, his paralysis pistol, fired a nerve 
gas that could paralyze or kill upon contact. His principal weapon was his 
lance, which was loaded with concealed weapons ranging from rockets to 
bola-launchers. His most impressive asset was his faithful steed, an 
honest-to-gosh flying horse genetically engineered by Garrett.<BR><B>Favorite 
quote:</B> "Surprised, thunder god? You didn't suspect my innocent-looking lance 
is in reality a most deadly arsenal of weapons!" (Avengers 6. Garrett gets the 
drop on Thor in his first outing with the Masters of Evil -- although how 
innocent-looking your average lance is might be debatable.) <BR><B>Heroes He 
Kept Running Into:</B> Giant-Man and the Wasp were Garrett's first foes. He 
later battled their fellow Avengers as a founding member of the Masters of Evil. 
Other adversaries included Spider-Man and Iron Man, who accidentally toppled 
Garret from his horse during battle, fatally injuring him.<BR>

<P></CENTER><B>People Who Think He's Not So Bad: </B>Garrett played nicely with 
his <A href="http://www.geocities.com/marvel_villains/moe/moe.html">Masters of 
Evil</A> teammates, but the one person who really gave a darn about him was his 
closest living relative, nephew Dane Whitman. Dane attended Nathan on his death 
bed, where Nathan confessed his crimes and passed the Black Knight mantle and 
weaponry on to Dane with the stipulation that he use it only for good. Dane 
complied and became the new heroic Black Knight, eventually joining the 
Avengers.<BR><B>Most Despicable Act:</B> As depicted in a recent issue of Untold 
Tales of Spider-Man, the Black Knight was indirectly responsible for the death 
of Spider-Man's would-be sidekick, Bluebird.<BR>
