width=327 align=left>Bullseye always had perfect aim. He was all signed up to 
become a major league baseball pitcher when he opted instead to volunteer for 
the war. The war brought out the killing side of Bullseye and the world is a 
poorer place for the transition. Bullseye is recognized as the top assassin in 
the business.</P>
<P><FONT size=2>Daredevil #131- flashback- Bullseye is seen in Vietnam. He was a 
very gung ho soldier and wanted to destroy the Cong. Bullseye was out patrolling 
one day when he heard a guerilla come up behind him. Bullseye’s gun jams, but 
before his opponent can draw his own gun Bullseye takes his gun and throws it 
through the guerilla’s chest. Bullseye always had perfect aim, and before he 
enlisted for the war he was signed up for Major League Baseball. </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2>Daredevil #131- flashback- After the war 
Bullseye became a mercenary in Africa.</FONT></P>

window. Mr. Hunnicutt, the man inside the room, unfolds the plane to read, “Pay 
me $100,000 or I will kill you!!! –Bullseye” Mr. Hunnicutt says that someone is 
going to answer for this tasteless joke. Bullseye is suddenly beside him and 
says that he doesn’t think so. Hunnicutt asks who he is. Bullseye says that his 
real name would mean nothing, but that he will recognize his stage name- 
Bullseye. Bullseye asks if Hunnicutt has the money that he wants here. Hunnicutt 
says that he doesn’t have it here, but before Hunnicutt can explain Bullseye 
picks up the pen off the desk and throws it into Hunnicutt’s neck. Bullseye 
tells him not to take it personally. Later Daredevil comes by to see what is 
described as a gruesome murder. Hunnicutt is laid against the wall with a 
bullseye painted on him and the wall he leans on. “This is an example to all who 
refuse to pay Bullseye.” Jake Conover asks Daredevil to come by his office. He 
tells him some things that an “informant” told him about Bullseye’s past. 
Daredevil correctly guesses that the one who told Conover was Bullseye himself. 
Daredevil swings away only to find that a grenade has just flown right by him. 
The blast causes Daredevil to land. As he comes down he is greeted by Bullseye. 
Bullseye says that his reputation is well deserved. Daredevil charges Bullseye, 
but Bullseye kicks a few cans of trash at Daredevil. Bullseye says that he has 
no wish to finish him now however. Bullseye tells Daredevil to follow him. 
Bullseye walks him towards the police where a bunch of cameras are around. 
Bullseye says that he wanted an audience. Bullseye says that he has men ready to 
shoot into the crowd if the police try to stop him. Daredevil leaps at Bullseye. 
Bullseye throws a rope around Daredevil’s throat. Finally the lights come on and 
they are standing in a circus.</FONT></P>

are supposed to be going over the books of Mr. Glenn, the father of Foggy’s 
girlfriend, looking for criminal activities Foggy’s girlfriend heads out to 
lunch with her father. As soon as she leaves the building Murdock hears a 
machine gun being cocked outside. Bullseye drives by the building and starts 
blasting away. Murdock runs after him as Daredevil. Bullseye drives the car into 
the water and jumps out right before. Daredevil arrives and Bullseye is thrilled 
that he just made a million dollars and that he gets to kill his most hated foe. 
Daredevil dodges Bullseye’s shot and manages to kick the gun from his hand. 
Bullseye throws a crate at Daredevil and follows it up with a trash can lid. 
Daredevil charges into Bullseye he falls into the water. Daredevil leaps in when 
Bullseye doesn’t surface. Bullseye was waiting with a trap and wraps seaweed 
around Daredevil’s throat. Daredevil kicks Bullseye and leaps out to the docks. 
Daredevil suddenly realizes that he can no longer “pick up” Bullseye anywhere 
around him. Daredevil is stumped, but he doesn’t hear in time the cardboard 
plane that hits him in just the right spot. Daredevil falls over into the water 
unconscious. Bullseye debates letting Daredevil drown, but he has a better idea. 
Bullseye pulls Daredevil up and hits him again for good measure. When Daredevil 
wakes up he finds himself strapped to the arrow of a giant crossbow. Bullseye 
waits for Daredevil to wake up and then shoots him </FONT>towards New 
Jersey.</P>

something is off. She sits down at her vanity mirror and takes off her 
bracelets. In the reflection Bullseye is sitting in a recliner holding her 
brush. Bullseye says, “A lovely night for a murder, isn’t it?” Bullseye throws 
the brush, but Widow dodges and the brush hits the mirror. Bullseye throws a 
picture frame into Widow’s face. Widow doubles around, but when she charges 
Bullseye he throws a flower vase into her face. Widow starts crawling after her 
bracelets. Bullseye wraps the electrical cord from Widow’s hair dryer around her 
neck. Widow swings her leg around and kicks Bullseye’s spine. She follows with a 
punch. She leaps at Bullseye, but he dodges and she kicks a mannequin. Bullseye 
throws something at the chandelier above Black Widow. The chandelier falls onto 
her. Bullseye says that no one is more resourceful than him. Bullseye says that 
he wants revenge on her love Daredevil. Bullseye pokes a picture of Black Widow 
with a bullseye over her face onto a knife. Bullseye throws the knife into the 
wall. Daredevil goes to her apartment and finds that Bullseye has her. He starts 
asking around after him.</FONT></P>

align=left></FONT><FONT size=2>Daredevil #169- Matt Murdock is the guest on a 
television show. As he speaks a special report breaks in to announce the escape 
of Bullseye from a hospital just before they were about to operate on him. When 
they return to the show Matt Murdock is already gone. Bullseye was apparently 
holding his breath during the anesthetize and then grabbed a scalpel, and 
started swinging. Bullseye stands on the street he looks around and every person 
seems to be wearing a Daredevil suit. As Bullseye walks he starts killing all 
the daredevils around him. Daredevil shouts that he is going to keep killing 
daredevils until there aren’t anymore. Bullseye walks into a tailor and gets a 
costume made. Bullseye kills the tailor and the fat businessman that came in as 
a customer. Bullseye’s head burns with pain. A tear rolls down his cheek and 
Bullseye says that he hates Daredevil. The doctor is telling Daredevil that 
Bullseye has a cancerous brain tumor that is causing his more erratic behavior 
and causing him to see hallucinations. If the tumor isn’t removed he will soon 
die. The police get word of Bullseye’s murders. Bullseye is sitting in a movie 
theater smoking a cigarette. One of the other customers knocks his cigarette out 
of his mouth. Bullseye starts killing. Bullseye kills the last “devil” just as 
the real Daredevil enters the theater. Bullseye lunges but Daredevil says that 
he is going to save Bullseye’s life even if he has to beat the crap out of him 
to do it. They fight for a bit until Bullseye spots two patrons that didn’t 
notice his killing spree. Bullseye tells Daredevil that it is either his life or 
the man’s. Daredevil stays still and Bullseye throws a knife into his chest. 
Daredevil uses his hand to block most of the shot. Bullseye makes off with his 
two hostages. Bullseye takes them to their apartment. Daredevil finds the 
hostage’s throat losange. Daredevil listens for the cough and finds them. Inside 
the apartment Bullseye has doubled over from the pain. The man is going to brain 
him with something heavy, but he loses his nerve. Daredevil bursts through the 
window as Bullseye is about to kill the pair. Daredevil and Bullseye fall down 
the stairs. Bullseye gets up and runs to the subway. Daredevil notes that it is 
far too noisy for his hearing to work well down there. Daredevil manages to pull 
Bullseye off a subway. He is swinging (literally) blindly because he can’t hear 
to guide him. Finally Daredevil gets hold of Bullseye and pounds until he is 
unconscious. Bullseye is unconscious on the tracks and a subway is coming. 
Daredevil thinks that he should just let him die, but he pulls him off the 
tracks. Bullseye’s operation is successful and the detective tells Daredevil 
that the next time he kills it will be on his head.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>Daredevil #171- The new bosses of the underworld frantically 
discuss their botched attempt to kill the Kingpin. Bullseye thinks to himself 
that to hear them talk you would think that Kingpin still ran the underworld and 
not them. Bullseye wonders if he has joined the wrong team. The bosses have the 
Kingpin’s wife and they want to make a deal for files that the Kingpin has on 
them that would put them all behind bars. They tell Bullseye to go deliver the 
message. Bullseye thinks how they have the world’s best assassin and they have 
him doing errands. Bullseye wonders again about these guys. Elsewhere Daredevil 
poses as “Shades” and gets hired to work for the Kingpin. One of Kingpin’s men 
enters and delivers the message from Bullseye just before he dies. Before the 
meeting Kingpin defeats Daredevil when “Shades” is trying to steal the files. 
Kingpin goes to the meeting. Bullseye is hanging upside down with a gun trained 
on Kingpin. Kingpin’s suitcase emits a sonic noise when it is opened. Bullseye 
falls unconscious. One man remains conscious and blows up the area where 
Kingpin’s wife is being held.</FONT></P>
