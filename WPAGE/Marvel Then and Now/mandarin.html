down and finds the ten rings that were left behind. Mandarin immediately 
recognizes them for what they are and that they can be used to his benefit, but

<P align="justify"><FONT face="Verdana">Avengers annual #1- Mandarin teleports Arthur Parks the pieces 
he needs to reconstruct his Living Laser equipment. When Living Laser collapses 
a roof on Iron Man as he is trying to escape Mandarin teleports him out. Iron 
Man gathers the old and new Avengers to tell them what he suspects. Living Laser 
changes into the outfit Mandarin had waiting for him. Living Laser said he 
thought Mandarin was dead, but Mandarin says that he simply teleported away. 
Mandarin further demonstrates this skill by teleporting in the rest of his 
recruits- Executioner, Enchantress, Power Man, and Swordsman. Mandarin then 
pretends to teleport Namor to recruit him. “Namor” mouths off to Mandarin so 
Mandarin “destroys” him. Everyone is intimidated by Mandarin’s power thinking 
that Namor was real. Mandarin takes the others and shows them a mammoth diamond, 
which they will use to take over the world. Mandarin starts to explain his plan. 
Later Mandarin watches as the Avengers break up to defend the three global spots 
that Mandarin’s forces have attacked. Mandarin contacts Swordsman and Power Man 
and tells them that stage two has begun. Power Man and Swordsman are defeated. 
Mandarin curses them for the “eternal bunglers that they are”. Executioner and 
Enchantress forget about their orders and engage Hercules and Scarlet Witch in a 
dimensional portal Executioner creates. Mandarin tries to order them, but they 
just go ahead. Hercules and Wanda win. Mandarin says that he should have known 
better than to recruit immortals that won’t obey any mortal. Living Laser is in 
Africa to be opposed by Thor and Hawkeye. After they down Living Laser 
Mandarin’s surprise climbs out of a volcano- Ultimo. Ultimo’s beams separate 
Thor from his hammer. Thor tries to run hoping it will lure Ultimo from the 
hammer, but Ultimo doesn’t move. Thor throws a boulder at Ultimo, but Ultimo’s 
beams disintegrates it. Mandarin is pleased with Ultimo and praises the day he 
found him. Hawkeye distracts Ultimo and lets Thor get his hammer. Ultimo has 
Hawkeye, but Thor hits Ultimo so hard that it drops him. Thor knocks Ultimo back 
into the volcano. Captain America and Quicksilver find Mandarin’s space station. 
Mandarin says that he didn’t blast them out of space because he wanted to 
destroy them personally. Cap and Quicksilver fight Mandarin long enough for the 
other Avengers. Mandarin says that he doesn’t care if they are there and shows 
them his giant diamond. Mandarin explains that the diamond emits hate rays that 
will cause the world to kill one another and he will conquer whoever is left. 
The diamond bathes the Avengers and they attack whoever is closest. Wasp however 
was closest to Mandarin and she blasts him. Mandarin tries again, but this time 
Quicksilver throws off the aim. The force bounces around and blows a hole in the 
wall of the ship. Mandarin is sucked out into space. The Avengers destroy the 
ship before leaving.</FONT></P>

digging party that the Mandarin sent out. Mandarin watches as they defeat his 
crew. Mandarin turns to his elderly company and says, “It is as you said, 
ancient one.” The old man says that if the Inhumans really exist then their 
Great Refuge must exist as well. Mandarin observes the Inhumans’ powers as they 
beat back Mandarin’s men. The old man says that they just stopped Mandarin’s 
latest attempt to find the fabled Eye of Yin. Mandarin says that nobody stops 
him and that he will have the Eye of Yin. Mandarin tells his lackeys to prepare 
his personal helicopter. As the Inhumans are about to leave Karnak notices 
something in the ground. Mandarin has a grenade thrown at them. Medusa catches 
it and shields the others from what turns out to be just gas. Mandarin orders 
his lackeys to shoot the others down. Gorgon stomps his foot, but Mandarin uses 
the ring with Magna Force and drives him into the mountain side. Karnak strikes 
the ground and natural gas erupts into flames. Mandarin uses his neutron ring 
and shields himself with a molecular barrier. Mandarin then creates a vortex to 
extinguish the fire, and uses a stun blast to knock out Karnak. Triton grabs 
Mandarin’s hands, but is forced to let go as Mandarin causes ice to form up 
Triton’s arm. The ice hardens and traps Triton and Mandarin turns his attention 
to Black Bolt. Energy starts to crackle from Black Bolt. The ground below 
Mandarin becomes soft and Mandarin sinks into the ground. Black Bolt becomes 
curious as to what Mandarin was looking for. Mandarin asks the old man how his 
plan is progressing. The old man says that it goes according to plan and that 
the Inhumans are going to find the Eye of Yin for him. Mandarin had sent a 
robotic version of himself to face the Inhumans. The Inhumans discover a temple 
built by the ancients. They come to an idol. The idol’s closed eye opens and 
power pours out.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal align="justify"><FONT face="Verdana">Amazing Adventures #4- Black Bolt snatches the 
Eye out of the idol, but as they look at it the Eye of Yin is snatched from his 
hands. The Inhumans think it some trick of the ancients, but the Eye is really 
being pulled by the magnetic beam of the Mandarin’s rings. Mandarin dissolves 
the power’s shell and absorbs the cosmic energy into his rings. The old man 
reminds Mandarin that it was his studying that made this possible. He reminds 
Mandarin of the great reward he was promised. Mandarin banishes the man to 
another dimension and says that it is a fitting journey for a inquisitive 
scholar. Karnak comes upon this scene and moves to attack. He means to collapse 
the chamber with one well-placed blow, but Mandarin bores a hole to the center 
of the Earth. Karnak starts to fall, but luckily for him Medusa arrives and 
saves him with her hair. Triton also arrives and the three of them advance on 
Mandarin. Mandarin traps them all within an atomic cage and starts to fill it 
with water. Mandarin tells Triton to teach his friends to breathe water. Black 
Bolt and Gorgon arrive and Black Bolt quickly uses an electron charge to shatter 
the cage. Mandarin starts to gloat about all his power and all the destructive 
things he will do with it. Gorgon stomps the ground. Mandarin says that his 
patience is growing short. He goes to kill the Inhumans but is frozen in place 
for some reason. Black Bolt hypnotized Mandarin as he ranted about his power. 
Mandarin collapses. Gorgon takes Mandarin’s rings off and carries him out. Black 
Bolt collapses the temple with the rings inside.</FONT></P>

his mento-intensifier ring from feet to miles. An accident renders Mandarin 
motionless. Many followers take the opportunity to run away, but his loyal 
servant Li Fong helps Mandarin escape through hidden tunnels before soldiers 
ransack his castle. Li Fong and the motionless Mandarin are taken in by Shan-Tu 
monks. Mandarin wakes up and has lost much of his memory. He remembers how to 
use his rings, but little else. Mandarin came to believe that his rings came 
from his ancestors and not an alien ship. He decides that his destiny is to 
raise China to the ruling power of the planet. The monks decide to follow him as 
the Hand. Mandarin constructs a powerful business and criminal 
cartel.</FONT></P>

of the man Hao that Tony Stark was supposed to meet with about setting up a 
branch of Stark Enterprises in Hong Kong. Iron Man grabs the guy, but instead of 
talking the assassin says that what he does, he does for the Hand and 
disintegrates himself. A single ring falls from his hand and hits the ground. 
The ring then disintegrates as well. Later on his private island the Mandarin 
stands as Xu opposes him. Mandarin says that the reward he is offering to any 
who can best him in unarmed combat is very generous. Mandarin needs to only use 
one hand to deflect Xu’s attack. He grabs Xu’s hand and discovers that he has a 
lacquer on his fingernails. Mandarin asks if he is vain or just greedy. Xu 
apologizes and says that the toxin was only meant to slow Mandarin not to kill 
him. Mandarin says that Xu was his favorite as he puts on his rings. Mandarin 
says that Xu shows no honor, and that honor is all. Mandarin says that without 
honor life is useless. Mandarin kills Xu. Mandarin stands next to the pile of 
ashes that was Xu, and says that he trusts that the rest have learned from this 
unpleasantness. Later Tony Stark is talking with his attorney Felix Alvirez. 
Alvirez says that this “Zhang Tong” seems to have the entire government in his 
pocket. Later at the afternoon meeting Stark meets Zhang Tong. He notes that 
while his appearance has changed that Zhang Tong is the Mandarin. Tony wonders 
why he doesn’t attack and why he doesn’t seem to recognize him. Zhang Tong says 
that Stark can’t do business in Hong Kong without his blessing. Zhang says that 
if Stark will work for him that he will let him. Stark says that he owns his own 
company, but Mandarin says that he might not for long. Stark leaves. The Hand 
kidnaps Jim Rhodes. Later still Mandarin meets with the Hand and tells them to 
bring him honor by defeating their enemy and restore China to its rightful place 
as the world’s ruling nation. As Iron Man arrives one of the Hand uses his ring 
to force Iron Man to land. Iron Man is then surrounded in black light. Iron Man 
uses his sensors to attack the Hand. Another attacks him with ice. As the Hand 
is defeated each ring returns to the Mandarin. Iron Man finally reaches 
Mandarin, but Mandarin doesn’t even stand up. Mandarin reveals to Iron Man that 
he had Jim Rhodes, Mrs. Arbogast and Felix Alvirez captured. Mandarin proposes a 
one on one duel. If Stark wins he can have his friends back and will be allowed 
to operate in Hong Kong, but if Stark loses he has to work for Mandarin 
exclusively forever. Iron Man accepts.</FONT></P>

Mandarin returns to his island fortress and prepares for the fight. His servant 
thinks about how changed the Mandarin is. Li Fong gives the Mandarin his robes 
after he is finished. Later as Mandarin goes over the rules of the contest and 
the production crew checks its equipment Soo Lin, a friend of Tony’s, pretends 
to be a new crewmember. The action begins. Mandarin flames the sand turning it 
into molten glass. He then freezes the glass and turns it hard. Iron Man breaks 
out. Mandarin traps him in a vortex beam. Soo Lin uses a computer to hack into 
Mandarin’s system and frees Stark’s friends. Iron Man gets free and tries an 
electromagnetic pulse. Iron Man’s armor is rendered useless for six minutes, but 
Mandarin’s rings seem unaffected. The cameras are also down. Mandarin knows that 
the prisoners have escaped. He gives the Hand five of his rings to deal with it. 
Iron Man’s armor goes back on, but he doesn’t want Mandarin to know so he won’t 
call his rings back. Mandarin downs Iron Man. He tells the Hand to go ahead and 
kill the prisoners. Iron Man blasts Mandarin. He keeps pouring it on until

Matsuo Tsurayba stands behind him after killing all those who made up Mandarin’s 
Hand. Mandarin asks him why he should not simply kill him. Matsuo introduces 
himself and says that he rid Mandarin of his lesser services so that he could 
offer him the services of the true Hand. Mandarin asks Matsuo if he is jonin or 
common genin. Matsuo replies that he is but a messenger. Mandarin asks what he 
needs with a messenger or the Hand when the least of his rings is enough to turn 
him into dust. Matsuo says that it is not the weapon but the wielder. Matsuo 
says that to defeat Mandarin all he needs to do is summon Iron Man. Mandarin 
tells him to continue. Matsuo says that before the turn of the century that 
China will return to sovereignty and that there has never been a better time for 
one to carve out a kingdom for himself. Mandarin says that he knows all this. 
Matsuo says that people are not going to follow one who can be defeated by a 
common yankee “superhero”. Mandarin asks what his solution is. Matsuo says that 
he offers a means to know his enemy’s secrets so that he might strike at them by 
cutting out their hearts. Mandarin tells Li Fong that he and his guest will take 
tea. Betsy Braddock undergoes a fantasy that starts in her own childhood. 
Everytime something bizarre happens she seems to pick up another ring and put it 
on. She pretends to fly a jet and winds up in a real one briefly. She has a 
sword fight with her brother that turns real for just a moment. She drives a 
Ferrari car at 180 mph. She goes to Mojo’s Body Shoppe and he transforms her 
from a westerner into an Asian body. Mandarin watches Betsy Braddock hooked into 
a machine with Matsuo. He asks who she is. Matsuo says that they think she is an 
X-Man. Mandarin says that he thought they were supposed to be dead. Matsuo says 
that they must be as skilled in deception as they are. Matsuo says that they 
found her in shock and with her memories totally fragmented. Mandarin watches 
their psychic defining her new reality. Mandarin asks why they are giving her to 
him. Matsuo says that an order of assassins need employment. In her mind Betsy 
Braddock demands Storm’s ring. Storm hands it over, but Betsy kills her just the 
same. Betsy wants all ten rings. She kills Colossus for another. She moves on 
and kills Dazzler for her sixth. Havok is running in Genosha and is about to 
fall from a great height. Psylocke says that she won’t let him drop for his 
ring. She takes the ring and then kills him so he won’t drop. Rogue and Carol 
Danvers lie separated on the ground. Psylocke picks up their ring. Suddenly 
Psylocke is confronted with Slaymaster. Matsuo is amazed at how Psylocke is 
resisting them. Slaymaster starts to take off her rings, and then rips out 
Psylocke’s eyes. As Psylocke fights back the Slaymaster armor is knocked off and 
underneath reveals the Mandarin. Mandarin tells Psylocke to accept him as her 
lord and master. Psylocke slays him. The machine is destroyed and the Hand’s 
pyschic is dead, but Psylocke kneels before Mandarin and returns his rings to 
him. Psylocke says that Mandarin is her master. </FONT></P>

Union. Captain America is with Nick Fury as he watches tapes of the event. He 
asks if they are sure that they were statues and not disguises. They are shown 
another tape where all the statues were verified to be stone or bronze, and yet 
two hours later they tried to attack the president. When the statues were 
defeated by the secret service they eventually transformed back into men. Fury 
takes off to figure out who it is. On the southern mainland coast of China the 
Mandarin sits in his castle. One of Mandarin’s lackeys shows him how easily 
their rings can be manipulated to alter stone. Mandarin asks whose rings they 
are. His minion corrects himself and says that it is all in Mandarin’s name that 
they do this. Another of Mandarin’s lackeys says that the deaths of one who 
might threaten them is a worthy pursuit. Mandarin says that the J-2’s could 
never harm him, but he does like the irony of using their monuments against them 
and allows them to continue. SHIELD discovers the satellite, but need one more 
beam to triangulate the origin. Fury attends the next J-2 meeting. The statues 
come to life and they get a point in Macao China. Fury gets a file on Mandarin 
from Iron Man. SHIELD goes to China. Mandarin invites them in. He says that he

satellite that gave him away. Fury says that it was. Mandarin says that his two 
men didn’t think to cover their tracks. Mandarin’s two men start to advance on 
Fury. Mandarin says that he did enjoy the view here, but that he has to leave 
now. Mandarin calls back the two rings on his lackeys. Mandarin says that these 
two will go with them. Fury tries to shoot Mandarin to prevent him, but Mandarin

dream again. Mandarin says that it is always the same dream. Chen Hsu says that 
it will continue coming as long as he refuses to learn its lesson. He says that 
the dream reminds Mandarin of his mortality. He reminds Mandarin that his father 
was killed the same way. Mandarin says that his father was a lesser man than he 
is. Mandarin says that he was bound by his own mortality. He says that he 
understood nothing of the world beyond China and nothing of power. Mandarin 
looks out to see Fin Fang Foom sleeping on his yard. Mandarin says that all that

defeated by Fin Fang Foom. Stark mentally commands an Iron Man armor from his 
hotel room. Mandarin stands with Fin Fang Foom and Chen Hsu and says that it was 
too easy. He says that Iron Man should not have fallen in less than twelve 
hours. Chen starts to suggest that perhaps the weakness was Mandarin’s when they 
hear a noise. They see another Iron Man coming. Mandarin says that he senses the

because of the relay of the commands having to go through a satellite. Jim 
Rhodes doesn’t know that Stark isn’t in the armor, and is watching him get 
clobbered. He tries to get up to help, but collapses. Mandarin says that was a 
valiant effort, but that it is useless without the power to back it up. Mandarin 
holds Rhodes in his hands. He says that he knows that he is not the true Iron 
Man. Mandarin wonders how many times when he defeated Iron Man was the victory 
hollow because it was not his true foe. Rhodes says that Mandarin should talk 
and says that there was a time when the Mandarin wouldn’t let a dragon do his 
fighting for him. Mandarin throws Rhodes down and says that he tires of the game 
back and forth. Mandarin says that no matter who is in the armor that Iron Man 
dies today. Iron Man hooks up two power lines to his armor. He blasts Foom and 
knocks him over. Mandarin tells Iron Man to leave the dragon alone, and says 
that the taunts of his friend “struck home”. Mandarin animates a giant rock and 
has it fall on Iron Man. Twenty minutes later Iron Man digs his way out of the 
rock to find Mandarin and Foom waiting for him. Mandarin and Foom start to 
attack Iron Man. Iron Man is forced to retreat. Foom shouts that he must not get 
away and rob him of his victory. Foom says that he is going to chase him down, 
but Mandarin says that he promised Iron Man death although he has no interest in 
the death of cowards. Mandarin turns to Jim Rhodes in the broken Iron Man suit

Mandarin recognizes the face of Chen Hsu, the man he had thought was his friend, 
and realizes that he has no idea what has been going on around him. The Dragons 
bellow. Rhodes notices that Mandarin is just as awestruck as he is and asks how 
he got involved with this crowd. Mandarin tells “Iron Man” to watch it because 
he can still kill him with a wave of the hand. Mandarin decides to tell “Iron 
Man” about his origin. Mandarin says that he has always been operating at but a 
fraction of the power of the rings. He says that with their full power he would 
have been unstoppable. Chen Hsu and the other dragons take human form and 
approach Mandarin. Mandarin asks Chen Hsu if he has come to mock him, but Chen 
Hsu says that Mandarin has learned much that will serve him as the Dragons take 
over the planet. Chen Hsu says that it is now time to turn over the rings to 
their rightful owners. Mandarin refuses saying that Chen Hsu was teaching him 
how to be the world’s ruler and now he is expected to be a servant. Mandarin 
says that where he rules he rules alone. Chen Su, Foom, and the other original 
ring holders begin to tap into the rings’ powers and they start to use it 
against Mandarin to get him to release the rings. Chen Hsu says that if Mandarin 
resists that his fingers will simply come off with the rings. Mandarin is in 
agony, but he does not weaken. He uses the lessons that Chen Hsu taught him and 
turns the center of his suffering into an unbreakable resolve. Mandarin takes 
possession of the rings full power. He laughs. Chen Hsu says that Mandarin’s 
mammalian traits are all that prevent him from mastering the rings. Mandarin 
blasts at Chen Hsu, but Chen has transformed back to dragon form. Foom tells 
Chen Hsu that he must kill Mandarin now. Chen agrees, but when he breathes fire 
at Mandarin the rings are now instinctually responding to Mandarin and shield 
him. Mandarin and the Dragons find themselves stalemated when Iron Man 
arrives.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal align="justify"><FONT face="Verdana">Iron Man #275- The Dragons attack Iron Man, but 
Iron Man is dodging their attacks. The fighting goes back and forth between the 
Dragons and Iron Man. Jim Rhodes tries to interfere, but Foom just grabs him and 
throws him away. Rhodes hits the ground. He lifts his head and sees the Mandarin 
sitting on a throne like chair thinking. Mandarin gets up considering power and 
betrayal. He doesn’t even notice Rhodes standing there. Jim puts his hand on the 
Mandarin’s shoulder, but Mandarin whispers “never touch me”. Mandarin blasts 
Rhodes through a mountain that is felt seven thousand miles away in California. 
Mandarin thinks about how he got into all this. He strikes out against the 
Dragons with Iron Man. Chen Hsu changes into his Dragon form and says that it is 
time to end this foolishness. Chen Hsu says that Mandarin doesn’t have the power 
to wield the rings as they do. Iron Man thinks and then tells the Mandarin to 
give him the rings. Mandarin says that Iron Man must be mad to think he would 
give his greatest weapon to his greatest enemy. Iron Man and Mandarin lock 
hands, but Iron Man moves around behind Mandarin and uses his own power to power 
the Mandarin’s rings. The resulting power is noticed worldwide. A piece of 
fabric of creation is ripped from its proper space and time. The power waves 
continue for sixteen hours, and when they finally stop the Dragons and the 
Mandarin are nowhere to be found. Six weeks pass and in the house of Li Sung the 
Mandarin lies recovering. He is better off and not as close to death as he was 
when they found him. The Mandarin lies in bed unconscious with bloody stumps 
where his hands used to be.</FONT></P>

nothing but search fro his rings. He follows a psychic bond that he shares with 
the rings. One by one Mandarin finds them until all ten rings are back on his

Mandarin walked the halls in spirit. Mandarin also realizes that he has been 
expected. Mandarin reaches out and touches the Heart of Darkness. Power flows 
over Mandarin. He says that he sees it now. He understands that it has all been 
by design. He understands that all his defeats have been part of the process. He 
says that Iron Man is the anvil against which he has been tempered like a blade

the voice replies that it is the proving ground of his soul. It says that it is 
the ground where his fate will be won or lost. The voice says that Mandarin has 
squandered his life trying to conquer the modern world. Mandarin is shown vision 
of his own past. It says that Mandarin cannot defeat his opponents using his 
opponent’s own tricks. It says that Mandarin has to discover his greater power 
that lies in his spirit. Mandarin asks how he might atone for his past. The

says that it is inconceivable to think that Mandarin was defeated. Mandarin says 
that he is only defeated by the worthiest of adversaries. Iron Man’s face is 
pictured on the Heart of Darkness and Mandarin says that he has been defeated 
many times by that one, and when War Machine is pictured Mandarin says that 
though his armor is new he knows his moves and that one has defeated him too. 
Mandarin says that they were both present when his hands were taken from him. 
Mandarin holds up his new dragonesque hands and says that now he has far

Mandarin prepares to ensure the attendance of their honored guests. To stop the

electro-magnetic pulse. Both armors are left useless. As Stark and Rhodes 
apologize to each other the Mandarin teleports onto the scene. Stark can’t see 
him, but War Machine can. He says that Stark isn’t going to like it. Mandarin

nullifies all technology. Mandarin says that he longs to unmask Iron Man, but 
that he won’t spoil that for now. Instead Mandarin unmasks War Machine. Rhodes 
asks if Mandarin remembers him. Mandarin says that he will never forget and then 
blasts Rhodes. Stark says, “in the name of God, Mandarin…” Mandarin reminds Iron 
Man that he is the only god there. In Hong Kong, Force Works is fighting 
Mandarin’s Avatars. Century recognizes the power surrounding the Avatars. He 
sets out to find its origin. Iron Man tells Mandarin that he is killing War 
Machine. Mandarin says that it is his intention to do so, and then to do it to 
him. Mandarin says that if Rhodes’ screams are bothering him that he will have 
them muffled. Mandarin orders War Fist to replace War Machine’s helmet. Rhodes 
tells Iron Man not to give Mandarin the satisfaction of seeing him upset. 
Mandarin says that the replacement shows more courage than the original. 
Mandarin asks Iron Man if he has grown soft. Mandarin makes it clear that he has 
won their war and that they will both die. Mandarin is about to kill War Machine 
when Century enters. Century is looking for the rings, but quickly tries to 
protect War Machine at Iron Man’s request. Mandarin blasts War Machine and

anti-technology field. Mandarin tells Ancestor and War Fist that it is enough 
for now. Mandarin, who mistakenly believes Century and War Machine dead, tells 
Iron Man that even though his two friends are dead that he is going to deny him 
that respite for a while longer. Mandarin remarks that Century’s staff and his 
rings seem to know each other. Mandarin says that perhaps he finally holds the 
secret to the life source of his power, and the key to more than even he ever 
dreamed. Iron Man tells Mandarin not to keep him alive too long because the 
first chance he gets he is going to kill him. Mandarin says that it is nice that 
he does have baser emotions. He tells him to dream of his revenge, and that he 
doesn’t want his spirit broken until the end. Mandarin tells the Avatars to 
watch Iron Man as he walks out. Force Works get directions to Mandarin from the 
one Avatar they managed to keep from escaping. Century manages to get War

<P class=MsoNormal align="justify"><FONT face="Verdana">Iron Man #311- Mandarin tells his Avatars to 
look at the enemy trapped within his useless armor. Iron Man says that this 
isn’t the first time Mandarin has thought him defeated. Mandarin says that he 
has not forgotten those humiliations particularly the one that cost him his 
hands and his rings. Mandarin says that the gods have granted him new hands to 
control the rings. Iron Man says that he thinks that the hands aren’t from gods, 
but from alien mutation from the rings. Mandarin shouts, “Silence!” and he 
blasts Iron Man. Mandarin says that he was once like Iron Man and turned his 
back on the wisdom of his ancestors. Mandarin says that he adopted the ways of 
the west, but that caused him defeat after defeat. Mandarin says that he has 
been remade and he knows now that it is his destiny to bring about the world’s 
salvation from all that corruption. Iron Man says that Mandarin has finally 
snapped. Mandarin blasts Iron Man again. Mandarin says that blind technocrats 
like him are the mad ones. Mandarin says that Iron Man has no idea of the power 
at his disposal. Mandarin says that fate lead him to this ancient castle, which 
resides on an intersection of powerful lines of Feng-Shui. Iron Man says that 
Mandarin has never used magic before. Mandarin says that all that is necessary 
is knowledge and power, and that he has all of both that he needs in the Heart 
of Darkness. Mandarin says that the Heart of Darkness has been waiting for his 
quickness, his intelligence, and his will to be able to utilize its magic. 
Mandarin summons a servant. He plucks energy from the Heart of Darkness and 
molds it into a mask. Mandarin puts the mask on the servant and transforms him 
into Turmoil, another Avatar. Mandarin blasts Iron Man with his heat and 
freezing rings at the same time. Mandarin tells the Avatars to leave and that 
this victory is to be his alone. Mandarin uses his disintergrator ring and opens 
Iron Man’s mask. Mandarin unmasks Iron Man and says that he will not be able to 
hide his pain from him this time. Mandarin says that he figured that Tony Stark 
was the one true Iron Man anyway. Mandarin grabs Stark by the throat and says 
that in both his incarnations he is what needs to be destroyed in the world. 
Mandarin says that they are like Yin and Yang, east and west, science and 
mysticism. Mandarin adds “living and dying” as he throws Stark away against the 
wall. Stark thinks about how his techno organic artificial nervous system is 
slowly shutting down in the anti-technology field. Because it is partially 
organic though it hasn’t failed completely though. Stark starts to say that if 
he wasn’t trapped in that armor he would do something, but Mandarin interrupts 
and says that Stark is nothing without his armor. Mandarin cuts the armor off 
Stark and says that Stark has been an honorable foe, and therefore deserves an 
honorable death. Man to man, no armor no rings. Mandarin smacks Stark with his 
new hands. Mandarin starts to beat the crap out of Stark. Stark gets a punch in 
which angers Mandarin. Mandarin says that he had intended to grant him a clean 
death, but now he will have to beg for mercy. Mandarin beats Stark to the ground 
until he cannot get up. Stark says that there will be others to oppose him after 
he is gone. Mandarin says that they too will fail. Mandarin hears a loud noise. 
He says that he has entertained himself long enough and that now it is time for 
Iron Man to die at the hands of the Mandarin.</FONT></P>

crackles with the power that would kill Stark. Just then the Scarlet Witch 
bursts through the ceiling. Mandarin throws Stark to the ground and asks Scarlet

buries Mandarin under falling rubble. Mandarin apologizes for underestimating 
her when he gets up. Wanda dodges Mandarin’s first blast, but it seems like he 
is going to get her with the second. Wanda protects herself with an explosion of 
local darkness that negates the Mandarin’s blast. Again Mandarin compliments 
her, but says that he is growing weary of this battle. Wanda blocks another 
blast from Mandarin. She gets close enough and punches Mandarin. He asks her if 
she thinks that she can beat him that way. Stark comes up behind Mandarin and 
hits him in the back of the head with the Iron Man helmet. USAgent and 
Spider-Woman break onto the scene fighting Avatars. Mandarin says that now he 
can burn them all together. Scarlet Witch uses her hex and Mandarin’s fire ring 
goes out of control. Force Works and Stark get away as Mandarin screams in 
agony. After he is done Mandarin looks around at the destroyed room and his dead 
Avatars. Other Avatars arrive and ask if they should go after them. Mandarin 
says that he has spent enough time with distractions, and that it is time for 
them to get to work. Mandarin says that by the time they make it back to 
civilization, civilization will no longer exist. In Hong Kong, Mandarin and his 
Avatars appear. He says that it is fitting that this cradle of modernity become 
his bridgehead. He says that before the day is out the world will bow before 
their god- him.</FONT></P>

on how to fight the anti-technology field. In Hong Kong, Mandarin tells his 
Avatars to look at the ruins of one of the great wonders of the “so-called 
civilized world”. Mandarin tells the Avatars to go forth and find any survivors 
and to prepare them for his coming. Mandarin says that his rule will be the 
greatest in history for while Khan ruled half the world he will rule it all. 
Mandarin says that from now on the land will be known by its ancient name. He 
proclaims the Empire of Cathay and proclaims himself the last emperor of Earth. 
Chu Lo Yan wants to kill Stark and the others, but most of his men rebel 
figuring Stark has the best chance to defeat Mandarin. Mandarin looks out over 
his new empire and army. Mandarin asks Major Chiang if his men are at the 
border. Chiang says that they will stop anyone from fleeing. Stark and the 
others make it to the border and into the Hong Kong branch of Stark Enterprises. 
The anti-technology field hasn’t affected Hong Kong and Stark uses the computers 
to send for equipment. He gets a new Iron Man suit and the others repair their 
technology. Mandarin is out addressing his new subjects saying that he brings 
them a world free from germs, crime, and nuclear annihilation. One of his 
“subjects” starts saying that his magic is no different than the weapons that he 
is “freeing” them from. She curses Mandarin out. Mandarin freaks. Power starts 
to pour out of the Mandarin as he says, “Silence…silence…I will have silence! I 
come among you with a gift, perhaps the greatest gift your miserable lives have 
ever known, and I am rewarded thus? Very well, then so be it! If you will not 
see what is best for you then I shall demonstrate it!” The power is now pouring 
out of Mandarin. His face fills the entire sky as he says, “See your concrete 
palaces crumbled to dust! See the world remade in my image! See the end of all 
that you knew, all that you held most dearly and bow to the power of the 
Mandarin!”</FONT></P>

Iron Man says that Mandarin will have to go through him first. Mandarin says 
that of anyone Iron Man isn’t the one who can stop him. Mandarin says that 
destiny has dictated that Mandarin destroy Iron Man, the worshipper of 
technology. Iron Man blasts Mandarin, but Mandarin just says that Iron Man is a 
fool and that he has no idea of the power at his disposal. Mandarin blasts Iron 
Man and sends him flying through a building that falls on him. Suddenly doubt 
comes over Mandarin’s face. He says that he will return and that they have all 
been warned. Century says that though Mandarin has immense power he is not yet 
its master. Mandarin shifts back into his mortal form. His consuming hatred for 
Iron Man prevents him from keeping total control of the power. Mandarin uses the 
last of his will power to teleport away and rest. Mandarin falls into a sleep. 
Century tells the others that Mandarin’s rings are well known throughout the 
universe. They are passed down through the ages destined to fall into evil 
hands. Iron Man tells Century about the Heart of Darkness. Century says that it 
has been though to be destroyed for 20,000 years. Century says that Mandarin is 
a nexus for all malignant magic. Century says that Mandarin’s nature is what 
makes him dangerous. Iron Man asks what if they changed the Mandarin’s nature. 
Iron Man works on a way to change Mandarin’s molecular structure the way his 
artificial nervous system affects him. Mandarin has nightmares. Demons are 
taunting him that he let victory slip from his grasp. Mandarin awakes and 
realizes that the dream was a warning. He says that he has tarried for too long. 
Mandarin says that he is going to master Parallax and orders the Avatars to 
bring him Iron Man. Mandarin is watching Force Works defeating his Avatars when 
Iron Man shouts to stop. Iron Man “surrenders” and the Avatars teleport out with 
him. Iron man’s suit is rendered useless again in the anti-technology field. 
Mandarin says that he finds Iron Man’s surrender suspicious. Iron Man says that 
when Mandarin humbled him he realized that Mandarin’s was the right path. Iron 
Man says that he would be free of technology. Mandarin says that he finds that 
hard to believe. Stark tells him to flip up his faceplate and look into his 
eyes. Mandarin does so and hits Iron Man. He says that even if he believed Iron 
Man he wouldn’t let him live. Suddenly the Mandarin starts rapidly aging. He 
asks what Stark has done to him. Stark says that Mandarin has been infected with 
a techno-organic virus that was covering his faceplate. Mandarin touches one of 
his Avatars and the Avatar turns to dust. Mandarin shouts that he is unclean. 
Mandarin crawls towards the Heart of Darkness and begs his masters to help him. 
Mandarin touches the Heart of Darkness and the mixture of magic and science 
causes the entire building to crumble. The next day at Stark Enterprises in Hong 
Kong, the new janitor (who looks remarkably like the Mandarin) walks by War

Iron Man is coughing up blood. He reaches Russia’s Ural Mountains and he sees 
Mandarin’s forces going up against the Winter Guard and the Russian forces. Iron 
Man asks the Winter Guard for help, but they need to keep defending their 
people. Iron Man flies up and sees Mandarin’s ship. The ship is shaped like a 
dragon and is over a mile long. The dragon turns towards Iron Man and fires 
plasma charges that Iron Man manages to dodge. Iron Man tries his repulsors, but 
the ship is impervious to them. Iron man keeps dodging the plasma cannons, but 
fails to see the tail whip around and hit him. Iron Man is finally swallowed up 
by the ship’s “head”. Iron Man walks along until he finally hears the Mandarin 
welcome him to the Dragon of Heaven. Mandarin says that it has been too long. 
Mandarin twitches his fingers and various parts of the ship attack Iron Man.

troops. The Avengers and the Winter Guard fly up to battle it. Inside Iron Man 
wakes up with his armor built into the wall. He is about to slip back into 
unconsciousness when the Mandarin, through his control rings, uses the Dragon of 
Heaven to force Iron Man’s armor to blow cold air into Stark’s face. Mandarin 
says that he was growing bored of watching Stark sleep and wanted to show him 
that the Iron Man armor is completely under his control. Mandarin tells Iron Man 
of how he survived their last encounter. Mandarin was the janitor in Stark 
Enterprises. Mandarin realized that he didn’t need to undo technology and make 
things as they used to be, but rather he realized that feudalism wasn’t dead it 
just transformed as Mandarin himself had been transformed into the janitor. He 
realized that the workers of technologies always reported upwards to a type of 
lord. Mandarin says that Stark is a lord of this age. He says that he was 
foolish to reject that which he should have sought to understand. Stark asks why 
he is invading Russia. Mandarin says that they have been splintered for a while 
and that he will be the strong arm to unite them again. Stark thinks to himself 
that the Mandarin’s words sound false, but without knowing the real reason. 
Outside the Avengers and Winter Guard can’t penetrate the ship at all. Wonder 
Man and Powersurge actually manage to break the Mandarin’s ship, but the ship 
heals itself. Vostok tries to take control of the ship through his metal 
controlling powers, but the ship almost takes control of him because of the 
immense power it possesses. Inside Stark is trying to explain to Mandarin the 
differences between slaves and workers, but Mandarin says that people who toil 
for a living are still beneath men like he and Stark. Stark hits a chin toggle 
that brings him back on-line. Iron Man breaks out and challenges Mandarin. 
Mandarin controls all aspects of the ship, and he pounds Iron Man with a huge 
steel cylinder. Mandarin asks Iron Man if he can win his respect. Mandarin has 
the ship fire missiles at Stark, but Iron Man shoots them down. Iron Man heads 
towards the powersource through the ceiling, but Mandarin just has the ship zap 
Iron Man where he is. Iron Man presses on to the powersource and blasts it. The 
ship starts to fall. On a screen, Mandarin is pleased that Stark ignored his 
anger and humiliation and pressed on to do what needed to be done. He says that 
Stark is his true opponent not his metallic shell. Iron Man heads back to save 
Mandarin, but Mandarin is already on a floating platform. Mandarin fades into 
the flames as the Dragon of Heaven hits the ground.</FONT></P>
