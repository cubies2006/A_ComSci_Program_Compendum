<H2>Captain Marvel/Shazam</H2>

<P><IMG src="CAPMAR_files/thrill1.gif" align=left> 
<P>Captain Marvel was created by C.C. Beck. Hist first appearance was as Captain 
Thunder in an ashcan comic titled Thrill Comics #1. His name was changed shortly 
afterward because Captain Thunder was already being used by another company. As 
a result, in Whiz Comics #2 Captain Marvel appeared, and he became more popular 
than Superman. Why was this? Well, there were many reasons.<BR>
<P>First, young readers could relate to Captain Marvel because he was a boy with 
superpowers. Young Billy Batson just had to say "Shazam" and he would become the 
powerful Captain Marvel. At this time, most of the comic readers were young 
boys, who after reading comics would fantasize about becoming a superhero 
themselves. <BR>
<P>Additionally, the stories were much better. The writers for Captain Marvel 
were much more creative than those who scripted Superman. A good example would 
be the villain Mr. Mind. Originally appearing as a voice over a radio, we would 
later find out that Mr. Mind was really a super intelligent worm from another 
planet! It was a shocking and more exciting villain than the typical robot or 
mad scientist that Superman was fighting. <BR>
<P>So successful was Captain Marvel that his title <I>Captain Marvel 
Adventures</I> would almost circulate 1.4 million copies per issue, on a 
bi-weekly basis in 1946. The Captain Marvel phenomena also expanded to his 
relatives. There was a Mary Marvel (sister), a Captain Marvel Jr., an Uncle 
Marvel, and even Hoppy the Marvel Bunny, as well as many others. <BR>
<P>Still, Captain Marvel had all sorts of legal troubles in his early years. 
They began in 1941 when DC filed a lawsuit against Fawcett Comics (publisher of 
the Captain Marvel titles). DC claimed that Captain Marvel was a copyright 
infringement on their character Superman. This case would finally come to trial 
in 1948; the courts decided in Fawcett's favor. The court stated that some of 
Superman's appearances were not published with the proper copyright material. 
However, the court did say that there were some similarities between the two 
characters. DC Comics appealed this decision and got a new trial in 1951. This 
court decided that because DC had no intention of abandoning the Superman 
character, their copyright was still intact, despite their earlier errors in 
publishing the proper copyright notices. In 1953, the case was finally settled 
out of court when Fawcett agreed to quit using the Captain Marvel character(s) 
and pay DC the sum of $400,000. <BR>
<P>A new hero called Captain Marvel was published in 1966 by M.F. Enterprises. 
This was a totally new character, and the title only lasted 5 issues with 
another one-shot appearance in 1967. Later in 1967, Marvel Comics would come up 
with their own Captain Marvel. This was also a completely different character, 
but an important one, because: 1) He would die of cancer, and 2) He remains dead 
to this day (an amazing and astonishing occurrence in the comic book world). 
<BR>
<P>In 1973, DC themselves revived the original Captain Marvel, but they were 
forced to call this title <I>Shazam</I> because Marvel Comics now held the 
trademark to the Captain Marvel name. Drawn by co-creator C.C. Beck, 
<I>Shazam</I> would last 35 issues. He would later re-appear in the 
<I>Legends</I> mini-series in 1986, then in his own <I>Shazam</I> mini-series in 
1987, and now in a title called <I>The Power of Shazam</I>, begun in 1995 and 
currently still in circulation.</P>
