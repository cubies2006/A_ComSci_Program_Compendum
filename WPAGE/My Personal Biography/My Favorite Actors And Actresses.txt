<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is my most favorite actress in South Korea that I had known. She is one
of the most beautiful faces that the world could offer. She was born on February 26, 1982. She played as Jenny on the "Autumn In My Heart". She also appeared
in "Guardian Angel" being the leading role as Dolly. She has other talents too aside from acting. She can play a piano and figure skating.
She's a buddhist. She dreamed to become a fashion designer. Just like Won Bin, she is popular because of her physical appearance not merely in
her acting skills.</P>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is not as popular as Won Bin and Song Seung Heon, but he is one
of my favorite actors in South Korea. Because his style is not of arrogant type not like the 2 mentioned earlier. He played as Raymond
in "Winter Sonata". And he also played as Harvey in "Loving You".</P>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is my most favorite actor in South Korea that I had known. He was born on September 29, 1977. He was voted
as the "Most Beautiful Man of April 2003". He is not only a popular actor, but he is also athletic. He knows how to play basketball,
computer games, taekwondo, swimming, motorcycle, and car racing. His favorite pet is puppy. His most favorite word is freedom. His good 
point was that he has a clear objective in whatever he does. But his bad point was that he's a little stubborn. I'd first known him in "Autumn 
In My Heart" as Andrew and in "Friends" with Fukada Kyoko as Kim Ji-Hoon. He is popular in terms of his physical appearances,
but not in his acting career. Before he was discovered, he was only a stylist of Cha In-Pyo.</P>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is my most favorite actress in Japan. She is not only beautiful, but she
also has a appeal of being sweet. She played as Tomoko in "Friends" with Won Bin. "Friends" is the first ever drama collaboration between Korea and Japan.</P>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the most common and most nice among the 3 leading actresses in the
Endless Love series. She is so simple to the fact that she can wear virtually any clothes which is suitable for her. She played as Abbie in "Summer Scent".</P>
