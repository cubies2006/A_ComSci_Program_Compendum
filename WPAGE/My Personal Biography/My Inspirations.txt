<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are something that gave me the motivation to strive hard in
my studies. They are my inspirations that keeps me going on and on with my life and studies. They are the following:</P>
<OL Type="A">
<li>My Parents
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the core of my inspiration. I do everything that I could to
help them so that someday I can raise our family status. And I also wanted to show them that I'll do my best to make
them happy and to secure their future. All of my goals and dreams in life, I pictured all of them with my parents. With all
the little and big things they had done, I wanted to give them all the comforts that I could offer to them someday. I really
planned to bring them to Mainland China.</P>
<li>My sister Athena
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I'd said before, she's my closest among our group of
siblings. Maybe because we're of the same generation since our age differs for 5 years. We also shared the same likes
and dislikes. We like many Korean drama series, MTV, and Soccer Games. We don't like Basketball, Filipino and Spanish
telenovelas at all. She is the most brightest among us siblings. She has a very good public relations, and she can handle
situations very well. I planned to go to South Korea with her to meet our idols namely: Song Seung Heon, Song Hye Kyo, 
Won Bin, Cha In-Pyo, and many others.</P>
<li>C++ Programming Language
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly at first, I do not know anything about this programming 
language. But as I'd learned to study this subject. I get to fell in love with it. So this inspired me and opened my world to 
study other programming languages like JavaScript, Visual Basic and Visual FoxPro. I love subjects that greatly deals with 
analysis because you get to learn it by really applying what you have learned. For this reason, I love all Math subjects like 
Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus, COARC, and Discrete and Logic Mathematics. And certainly I hate subjects that require 
one to memorize such as History, Sociology, Psychology, and others.</P>
<li>Mathematical Subjects
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have started to love Math when I was in Grade School..then into my high school days,
I started to like Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry and Statistics.. In PCHS, Students are required to have 60% of the subject to pass.. 
so this is the reason i study so hard and i like it a lot, because is analytical, even if you memorize the format, you can solve the problems.</P>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when i have entered college i liked all the math and computer subjects because its 
all analytical and no need to memorize the whole book, but still you can pass... Differential and Intergral Calculus. Currently, im studying, logic 
mathematics... and i seem to like it too.. i find math very challenging and exciting...</P>
