<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a very conservative and decent person.. just simple one's... 
so basically, you could see me wearing T-shirts plain blue, red or green... but i dont wear black.
I have simple taste in clothes. I'm of simple type, I do not wear clothes that is fabulous. 
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practically, I wear T-shirts with printed materials, you can see me wearing that 
during saturday and sunday. At times, I wear T-shirts with anime painted on it, its cool so I wear them everytime I go to 
SM City North Edsa, Rustan's, Robinson's place, SM Megamall and Glorietta . 
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at special occasions, I wear barong like birthday party... 
specially I like pinya.. and cordoroy.... like silk, and synthetic... extravagant one. 
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In weddings, and other occassions except Christmas, I wear polo shirts. I rarely put a gel in my hair. 
Because I have heard that gel can let once hair thin.
could make one's hair bald.</P>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but on Christmas and new year.. i wear a tuxedo to look presentable on parties at hotels..
sometimes i wear coat and tie like that on my big sisters wedding...
