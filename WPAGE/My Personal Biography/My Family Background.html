<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parent's roots are Chinese in origin. But my father was naturalized and became a 
Filipino citizen. While my mother is a pure Chinese citizen. My father came from a middle class family.
While my mother came from a poor one. My father was the 3rd among the siblings. He is considered to be the most
unfavored by his parents. I don't know why although he's very intelligent. His father came from Fookien, China. My grand-grandfather used to
be a respected town-elder which is comparable to our present Barangay captain. On one occassion, because of clanish war, his son which is my
grandfather's father, which was held hostage and was killed by a group of goons. After that, my great-grandmother remarried again. But events
turned out to be sour to my grandfather. He was occassionally mistreated by his stepfather. On one occassion, he run away from home and join
my great-great grand-father's cousin and migrated to the Philippines in order to escape the oppressive treatment of his stepfather. During his
stay in the Philippines, he started doing add jobs, messenger jobs, salesman jobs, and learn the ropes of the trades. After years of sacrifices
and hardwork and diligence, he was able to set up a small business of buy and sell. And later, it expanded into a small lumber yard and hardware.</P>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, he went back to China and married my grandmother. They bear 7 children: 4 males (which 
includes my father) and 3 females. Soon, these children grown up and they started to help in the family business. But too bad, my grandfather
contacted lung cancer because of his habit of being a chain-smoker during his youth. But after his death, the family business dwindled and the
family fall apart. Everybody has their own life to take care of and at that time, logging was totally ban. So it was very hard to get lumber supplies.
So some of the family switched to other businesses or endeavors. Some were successful and others were not because they grew up in an environment 
where the business is hardware and construction supply. Some of his brothers greedily acquired and sold family properties without parting other 
members. We were one family that were left out of such transaction.</P>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, about my mother and her parents. My grandmother (mother's side) is a widow managing a
small sari-sari store in Mayhalique. Religiously buddhist, kind, sincere, and loveable. We loved our mother's mother over our father's mother. 
My grandmother was of a poor class. But through her persistence and struggles, she was able to raise a family of 4. In the siblings of 4, 3 girls 
and a boy. My mother is the youngest among them. But Pedro, my uncle is the pet of my grandmother (mother's side).</P>

<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the financial crisis that we're experiencing and the downtrend of businesses, my father
has to close his small shop and temporarily lease the place to another person dealing in Auto Supplies. From the rental due, this is where we get our
family expenses. But sometimes, we had to make ends-meet and also had to secure loan from my auntie in Dagupan in order to pay off some emergency
expenses. My parents were very thankful that I got a scholarship at UE. And this lightens their financial load.</P>
