<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family! It's got to be the most important
part of my life. Because there's no one I can rely on except them. There is a saying that 
"Blood is thicker than water!".  About my parents, they were both introduced by their friends. 
They became fiancee and fell in love. And after 2 months, they engaged, and a month later, they 
married on Jan 6 of 1970. My parents wanted to have a baby boy in the family. Before I was born, my 
parents gave birth to 4 girls or shall I just say my sisters. On November 10 of the same year, my mom 
gave birth to my eldest sister named Rosalind. 4 years later, my mom bear a twin named Lili and Lulu. 
Then 6 years later, the youngest and the closest among my sisters was born. Her name was Athena Rose. 
My parents waited for another 5 years until I was born. And they're very happy to have a baby 
boy in the family.</P>

<dd><P align="justify">My mom is one of the most significant person that I'd ever known. I owe everything 
that I am now to her and my dad. She is the most sweet, caring, loving, and very thoughtful 
that I had known in my entire life. Also, she's a religious one believing in Buddhism. I can't substitute her 
to anyone. Of course, I really love her as my mother. My looks is what I'd inherited from her. I also knew that she 
was the favorite among the siblings. She is the youngest among her group of 4 siblings. They 
lived in Mayhalique, Manila. She was born on a Post-WWII period which is September 21, 1948. During her time, she 
didn't like studying and she's afraid to attend classes especially those times when the teachers are very strict. Education systems
during those times were very undemocratic. They allow teachers to beat their students' hands for failing grades. This is the reason
why she reached 1st year High School only. And she has a phobia in attending school. She studied at PCHS Main (located in Jose Abad 
Santos, Manila near Mayhalique). And when she turned 23, she got to meet my dad.</P></dd> 
<li><Font color="Blue" size="5" face="Monotype Corsiva">Leoncio Dee</Font>
<dd><P align="justify">My dad who always give good judgment about anything. He's very intelligent and very talented in 
the field of arts and designing. His main interests are news, politics, and origami. He loves us all although he didn't 
say it but you can feel it. Maybe I inherited some of his intelligence which appeared when I was about 18 years old. He 
came from a middle-class family. He was born on during WWII which is December 6, 1944. He is the third among 
their group of 7 siblings. They lived at Herran (the present-day Pedro Gil), Paco Manila. Not that I'm proud of my dad, but 
he's got to be one of the most good-looking among them. He started studying when he's 5 years old at ICA (Immaculate Conception 
Academy). The school offers kinder, elementary, and high school courses. But they accept male students up to grade 4 only. The 
school is directly in front of St. Augustine Church, the oldest church in the Philippines. This church is where Miguel Lopez De 
Legaspi was buried. But after sometime, ICA transferred to San Juan. they suggested that my dad to transfer at Xavier in San Juan 
but at that time they were living at Quezon City near boundary of Manila, which made it very inconvenient so they've decided to 
enroll at St. Stephen High School in Masangkay (formerly known as Magdalena). Their teachers in this school were Episcopal 
protestant missionaries from Canada and U. S. A. (now it was Filipinized during the time of Marcos). He became the Student Council 
President during his study at 4th Year H. S. which means he was very active in many of the extraccuricular activities like the 
oratorical, and arts contests. He became the director and the painter of the set design of the plays that are presented in the 
school. He graduated with honors. When he got to college, he studied Fine Arts at the University of Santo Tomas. He met my mom 
when he was 27. They got married on December 7, 1969.</P>

<dd><P align="justify">My eldest sister who was born on November 10, 1970. She is the most organized among our group of siblings.
Although she's not intelligent, but she is smart. She also loves to paint pictures of different themes. She first studied at
PCHS Annex. And she graduated at the Far Eastern University with her course Fine Arts. She's very helpful for my mother and father.
She even went to Taiwan to work and give my parents money to spend with. Now, she has a family of her own with 2 kids: a boy named Ken
and a girl named Lana.</P>

<dd><P align="justify">They're my twin sisters, who are alter-ego of each other. They both loved English as a subject and hates anything related in Math and Sciences. They also graduated from PCHS Annex. At college, Lili graduated
at De La Salle University with the course of Commerce Major in Marketing and Lulu graduated at University of Santo Tomas with also the
same course. Do you wonder how Lili got studied at DLSU although we're not that rich? It's because she forces my parents to let her 
study at DLSU and in turn my parents uses the money earned by my eldest sister for her to study there.</P>

<dd><P align="justify">The last and my closest sister among the group of siblings. We talked about anything the world has to offer. She
is a type of person who has mood swings and very talkactive. She also first studied at PCHS Annex. And studied at CEU with the course
of Computer Science. Then a year later, she transferred at Chiang Kai Shek with the same course. Then she stopped for 2 years. 
Then after 2 years, she again transferred at PSBA with Accounting course. Then now, she has decided to transfer at my university UE. I
hope that this will be her final course and she will stay put on this course and no one transferring.</P>
