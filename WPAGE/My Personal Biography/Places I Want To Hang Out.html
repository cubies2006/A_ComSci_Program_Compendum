<li><Font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5">SM Shopping Malls</Font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SM is one the most favorite places that I've hang out 
with. Because there you can buy almost anything you want, but you must have the money in order to buy 
them. I also watched the latest movies there. Occassionally, it is the venue of the neophyte foreign 
artists who would like to promote their song albums as well as to enhance their popularity worldwide. 
Like for instance, M2M, Steps, and Ant & Dec had a mini-concert at different SM branches like Megamall, 
City Edsa, City Manila, and others.</P>
<li><Font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5">Park</Font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the most peaceful places that I could go.
Because in the park, you can enjoy the cool breeze, the serenity of the place which is very conducive for 
studying, and the ambiance of the park, the greeness of the place such as trees, grasses, plants, and 
shrubs. One of the secret of studying is concentration. And in an environment like this it not only 
refreshes your mind it also soothes your intellectual soul.</P>
<li><Font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5">National Book Store</Font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place is one of the places that I go in SM. Because
I always check out the latest books in Star Wars and Calculus Books. I feel very happy whenever my father
bought me the books or things that I want whenever we visited National Book Store.</P>
<li><Font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5">Odyssey</Font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the place, that me and my sister most likely to hang
out with. Because we can look up the latest albums of our  favorite artists. And in some Odyssey branches, you
can listen to your favorite artists' CD tracks which comes handy and you can come back for more some other
time.</P>
<li><Font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5">SM Cinema</Font>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the place that I want to go with. Because you
can enjoy the amplified sound and view the latest movies of your favorite actors and actresses. In addition, it 
is enjoyable to watch a movie together with your own family. I remember the times when I with my family watched 
the cinema. One of the most finest memories in cinemas is the first time when I'd watched the first ever cartoon
on the big screen. It was me and my father and my sister Athena went to SM City Cinemas to watch "Snow White and 
The 7 Dwarfs".</P>
