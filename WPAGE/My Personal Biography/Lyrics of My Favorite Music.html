I'm so tired of being here,<br>
suppressed by all my childish fears.<br>
And if you have to leave<br>
I wish that you would just leave,<br>
'cause your presence still lingers here<br>
and it won't leave me alone.<br><br> 
These wounds won't seem to heal.<br>
This pain is just too real.<br>
There's just too much that time cannot erase.<br><br>
<I>When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears,<br>
when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears,<br>
and I've held your hand through all of these years,<br>
but you still have all of me.</I><br><br>
You used to captivate me<br>
by your resonating light.<br>
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind.<br>
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams.<br>
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me.<br><br>
These wounds won't seem to heal.<br>
This pain is just too real.<br>
There's just too much that time cannot erase.<br><br>
<I>When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears,<br>
when you'd scream, i'd fight away all of your fears,<br>
and i've held your hand through all of these years,<br>
but you still have all of me.</I><br><br>
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone.<br>
But though you're still with me<br>
I've been alone all along.<br><br>
<I>When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears,<br>
when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears,<br>
and i've held your hand through all of these years,<br>
but you still have all of me, oh</I><br>
Me, oh<br>
Me, oh<br>

<B>EVERYBODY'S FOOL</B><br><br>
perfect by nature<br>
icons of self indulgence<br>
just what we all need<br>
more lies about a world that<br><br>
<I>never was and never will be<br>
have you no shame don't you see me<br>
you know you've got everybody fooled</I><br><br>
look here she comes now<br>
bow down and stare in wonder<br>
oh how we love you<br>
no flaws when you're pretending<br>
but now I know she<br><br>
<I>never was and never will be<br>
you don't know how you've betrayed me<br>
and somehow you've got everybody fooled</I><br><br>
without the mask where will you hide<br>
can't find yourself lost in your lie<br><br>
i know the truth now<br>
i know who you are<br>
and i don't love you anymore<br><br>
<I>it never was and never will be<br>
you don't know how you've betrayed me<br>
and somehow you've got everybody fooled</I><br><br>
<I>it never was and never will be<br>
you're not real and you can't save me<br>
somehow now you're everybody's fool</I><br>

<B>I BELIEVE IN LOVE</B><br><br>
I feel the heat around me<br>
I feel the beat surrounds me<br>
Could this be for real, I wonder<br>
No need for hesitation<br>
It's time for celebration<br>
Will this be the night I've waited for<br><br>
When angels fall in love<br>
Heaven knows, does it show, oh<br>
If this love, will last for eternity<br>
Set me on fire<br><br>
<I>[Chorus]</I><br><br>
<I>I believe, I believe in love<br>
And like the stars above<br>
They shine, let it shine over me<br>
Set me free I believe in you<br>
And that our love is true<br>
Oh I believe, I believe<br><br></I>
I see that people dancing<br>
Boys and girls romancing<br>
They want this to last forever<br><br>
Cause underneath the moonlight<br>
Everything is alright<br>
We're reaching our hands up in the air<br><br>
To where the souls alive<br>
Heaven knows, that it shows oh<br>
If this love, will last for eternity<br>
Set me on fire<br><br>
<I>[Chorus]</I><br><br>
How could I doubt, what was meant to be<br>
Everything I needed was in front of me<br>
Your healing touch, will lift me up in the sky, so high<br><br>
<I>[Chorus]</I><br><br>

Say it's true, there's nothing like me and you<br>
I'm not alone, tell me you feel it too<br><br>
And I would run away<br>
I would run away, yeah..., yeah<br>
I would run away<br>
I would run away with you<br><br>
<I>Cause I am falling in love with you<br>
No never I'm never gonna stop<br>
Falling in love with you<br><br></I>
Close the door, lay down upon the floor<br>
And by candlelight, make love to me through the night<br>
(through the night, through the night...)<br><br>
Cause I have run away<br>
I have run away, yeah..., yeah<br>
I have run away, run away<br>
I have run away with you<br><br>
<I>Cause I am falling in love (falling in love) with you<br>
No never I'm never gonna stop<br>
Falling in love with you...<br>
With you...<br><br></I>
And I would runaway<br>
I would runaway, yeah..., yeah<br>
I would runaway (runaway)<br>

<I>Cause I am falling in love (falling in love) with you<br>
No never I'm never gonna stop<br>
Falling in love with you...<br><br>
Falling in love (falling in love) with you<br>

<B>CLOSER</B><br><br>
I see you, walking everyday<br>
With a smile beneath frown<br>
But I won't look away, yeah<br><br>
What does it mean<br>
What's there to see<br>
If I look<br><br>
Closer, closer, closer, closer<br>
Closer, closer, closer, closer<br><br>
Where are you going<br>
And what are you thinking at all<br>
Your eyes show nothing more<br>
Than a dazed oblivion<br>
What does it mean<br>
What will I see<br>
When I look<br><br>
Closer, closer, closer, closer<br>
Closer, closer, closer, closer..., ah, yeah<br><br>
You don't see me<br>
Watching everyday<br>
My smile could warm your frown<br>
And I'd never look away, never look away<br><br>
There's more to me (there's more to me)<br>
Than what you see<br>
When you look<br><br>
Closer, closer, closer, closer<br>
Closer, closer, closer, closer<br>
Closer, (close....r) closer, closer, closer..., ah yeah-ie...<br>
Closer, (ah ha) closer, (ah ha) closer, no, no, no, (ah ha)<br>
(ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, ah ha,) ah, no, no...<br><br>

<B>LOOKING IN THE EYES OF LOVE</B><br><br>
I wonder should I tell you<br>
About all the crazy things that I have done<br>
I've been hiding all my life<br>
When I should have stayed<br>
I tried to run...<br><br>
I was searching for an answer<br>
In a world so full of strangers<br>
But what I found was never really enough<br>
Now that I've found you<br>
I'm looking in the eyes of love (In the eyes of love)<br><br>
Baby you've been good to me<br>
Oh, so much more that you could know, yeah, yeah<br>
I never thought that I would find<br>
Someone who's so sweet and kind<br>
Like you...<br><br>
Please believe me when I say<br>
This time I won't run away<br>
I swear be all the heaven's stars above<br>
Now that I've found you<br>
I'm looking in the eyes of love<br><br>
<I>Looking in the eyes of love...<br>
I can see forever, yeah...<br>
I can see you and me<br>
Walking in this world together<br><br>
Oh, my heart's found a hope...<br>
I've been dreaming of...<br>
Now that I've found you<br>
I'm looking in the eyes of love<br><br>
Looking in the eyes of love...<br>
I can see (forever), I can see forever<br>
I can see you and me<br>
Walking in this world together<br><br>
Oh, my heart's found a hope<br>
I've been dreaming of...<br>
Now that I've found you, I've found you<br>
I'm looking in the eyes of love..., yeah<br><br>
Oh...<br><br></I>

Don't let your head rule you heart<br>
Don't let your world be torn apart<br>
Don't keep it all to yourself<br>
Just let all your emotions run free with someone like me<br>
That's the way it should be<br>
Someone like me<br><br>
I know Its hard when you're feeling down<br>
To lift your feet up off the ground<br>
We make mistakes but doesn't everybody<br>
You don't always have to agree with someone like me<br>
That's the way it should be<br>
Someone like me<br><br>
We know the story so far (what you want and who you are)<br>
What you want and who you are (Free)<br>
Let all your emotions run free<br>
You don't always have to agree<br>
With someone like me<br>
That's the way it should be<br>
Someone like me<br>
Someone like me<br><br>

I learned a lesson in my life<br>
But I learned it the hard way <br>
I don't know why I used to fall in love<br> 
With the wrong kind<br><br>
Then I suffer so much pain<br>
But I only had myself to blame<br>
maybe you came<br> 
In the nick of time to show me<br><br> 
<I>Love doesn't have to hurt<br>
To feel good<br> 
It's such a revelation<br> 
With you I can be myself<br> 
I know it should<br> 
Don't have to cry<br> 
Don't have to fight<br> 
Don't have to die<br> 
Not after tonight<br> 
Show me<br> 
Love (Love)<br> 
Doesn't have to hurt to feel good<br><br></I>
Darling now it seems to me<br> 
Like I've always known you<br>
But I still shudder<br> 
When I think back<br> 
On the lonely times<br><br> 
I used to keep all my feelings inside<br>
From your eyes I have nothing to hide<br> 
Baby you came<br> 
In the nick of time to show me<br><br>
<I>Love doesn't have to hurt<br>
To feel good<br>
It's such a revelation<br> 
With you I can be myself<br> 
I know it should<br> 
Don't have to cry<br> 
Don't have to fight<br> 
Don't have to die<br>
Not after tonight<br>
Show me<br>
Love (Love)<br> 
Doesn't have to hurt to feel good<br><br></I>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>
Thank you baby<br><br>
Lying here beside you<br> 
Feels so fine<br> 
Talking about everything in this heart of mine<br><br> 
<I>Love doesn't have to hurt<br>
To feel good<br>
It's such a revelation<br> 
With you I can be myself<br> 
I know it should<br> 
Don't have to cry<br> 
Don't have to fight<br> 
And in your arms<br> 
Not after tonight<br>

Love (Love)<br> 
Doesn't have to hurt to feel good<br></I>

If you see me walking down the street<br>
Staring at the sky<br>
And draggin' my two feet<br>
You just pass me by<br>
It still makes me cry<br>
But you can make me whole again<br><br>
And if you see me<br>
with another man<br>
Laughing and I'm joking<br>
Makin' the best of this I can<br>
I ain't try to put you down<br>
Baby I still want you around<br>
Coz you can make me whole again<br><br>
<I>Looking back on where we first met<br>
I cannot escape<br>
And I cannot forget<br>
Baby you're the one<br>
You still turn me on<br>
You can make me whole again<br><br></I>
Time is layin' heavy on my heart<br>
Seems I've got too much of it<br>
Since we've been apart<br>
My friends make me smile<br>
If only for a short while<br>
If you can make me whole again<br><br>
<I>Looking back on where we first met<br>
I cannot escape<br>
And I cannot forget<br>
Baby you're the one<br>
You still turn me on<br>
You can make me whole again<br><br></I>
for now I'll have to wait<br>
but baby if you change your mind don't be too late<br> 
coz I just can't go on<br> 
it's already been too long<br>
but you could make me whole again<br><br>
<I>Looking back on where we first met<br>
I cannot escape<br>
And I cannot forget<br>
Baby you're the one<br>
You still turn me on<br>
You can make me whole again<br><br>
Looking back on where we first met<br>
I cannot escape<br>
And I cannot forget<br>
Baby you're the one<br>
