<P align="justify">Every people wanted to have some special things that they want to possess. The major problem of acquiring 
the things that you want is the price. If the certain commodity is expensive then you must work hard for it in order to get it. Well in
my case, although I have a comfortable life despite trackloads of school work, I have some things that I want to have like any other 
people does.</P>
<OL Type="A">
<li>PLAYSTATION 2
<IMG src="PS2.jpg" align="left">
<IMG src="PS22.jpg" align="right">
<P align="justify">The first and foremost among the things that I want to have. This is Playstation 2 from SONY. This baby was
very expensive around Php 13, 000. The great features of this game console are the following: 1.) You can make it stand (on the right)
or on its default form (on the left). 2.) Not only you can play Playstation 2 CD, but you can pop in the old Playstation CD on this game 
console and enable to play them. 3.) You can listen to CD music. And 4.) You can watch movies both in VCD and DVD format. I plan to 
have one probably March of 2005.</P>
<li>PRINTER
<P align="justify">Although I have my own PC and a PC Table, I don't have a printer. It is very difficult to print outside. It not only wasting
your energy but also your time and money. Because you need to go there by riding on a jeep and print (the minimum is Php 3.00 per page).
I plan to have a printer next year.</P>
<li>SCANNER
<P align="justify">Another thing that I wanted to have is a scanner. Because it is very inpractical to scan outside. For every picture that you
scan, it costs Php 5.00 per small pictures and Php 3.00 per large-scale pictures. I've got to have one next year.</P>
