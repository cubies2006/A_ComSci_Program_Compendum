<P align="justify">Typically, I love TV shows that revolves around love story, anime, and superheroes.
My most favorite TV show during my childhood days is Masked Rider Black. The story revolves around the 
hero of the story, Robert Akizuki (originally called as Tetsuo Kurata in Japan) being the victim of the
abduction of an evil organization known as Golgom along with his stepbrother and bestfriend Stephen 
(Nobuhiko Akizuki). They were the 2 unwilling chosen candidates to be the successor of the present Eon 
King which will be called as Black Sun and Shadow Moon respectively. Robert had managed to escape with the
help of his stepbrother leaving his stepbrother behind who suffered injuries. Since that day on, he renounced
his identity as Black Sun and became Masked Rider Black who fights for justice and has a mission of saving 
his stepbrother from the hands of Golgom. After many battles with the Golgom, he didn't get close enough in 
rescuing his stepbrother, which gave Stephen the ample time to evolve into a Century King known as Shadow Moon.
In the end, the 2 closefriends became rivals for the Golgom throne. Shadow Moon needed to kill Black and 
acquire his kingstone in order to become the next Eon King. But Masked Rider Black managed to defeat Shadow Moon
and defeated single-handedly the forces of Golgom. From the pictures below from left to right are Robert Akizuki (Tetsuo
Kurata who became Masked Rider Black which is located on the lower left), Restlie (Stephen's younger sister), Kazumi (Stephen's girlfriend), and Stephen
(Nobuhiko Akizuki who became Shadow Moon which is located on the lower right). I also enjoy watching other superheroes like Bioman, Maskman,
and Shaider. But I can't really remember their stories maybe because when I'd watched the following series, I was just
6 or 7 years old.</P>

<P align="justify">During my high school days, I get to enjoy different animes like Samurai X, Fushigi Yuugi and Ghost Fighter.
Although I still enjoy watching Power Rangers during this period. Among the 3 animes, Samurai X is my most favorite because
the anime has a very serious theme of a typical ancient Japanese life and swordsmanship. This is also the period where I started 
to love different Marvel superheroes like Spiderman, Batman, and Iron Man. I always watched "Batman: The Animated Series" and 
"Batman Beyond" on Studio 23. Little by little, my appetite in watching superheroes turned bitter and I'd started to love 
MTV. During this time, I was very much influenced by my closest sister Athena to watch MTV. So up to now, I get the 
habit of watching different MTV Shows. I enjoy watching MTV because it's a form of relaxation for me and my sister.</P>
<P align="justify">During this college days, I became indulged in many Korean drama series which are shown. First
and foremost is the Endless Love series, which deals with different love stories that corresponds to its symbolic
season. Among its 3 series, the "Autumn In My Heart" is got to be the most finest series. Because the situation is
very complex. The 2 leading characters Johnny and Jenny loved each other since they 
were young. This love was not a brotherly love, although they considered themselves to be siblings. One day, Johnny
left Jenny without saying anything about it to her. As the years passed by, they had a love life of their own: Johnny
to Yoomi and Jenny to Andrew. But accidentally they met once again. And this time, their love became much stronger that
withstood all the objections of the Yoon family, Yoomi, and Andrew. Not until, Jenny found out that she has leukemia. Johnny
had been on her side during the last days of her life. The day after Jenny's funeral, Johnny committed suicide by bumping 
himself on a huge track. The next installment of the Endless Love series is "Winter Sonata" which is a love story that faces
many objections from their respective parents because of their parent's love conflict that occured years ago. This is my
least favorite in the series. The latest installment is the "Summer Scent" which is another love story that has a mysterious
past. Carlo has a fiancee named Hanna who had died due to a car accident. Her deceased girlfriend's heart had been 
transplanted to another woman named Abbie, who was suffering in heart ailment. During this time, Abbie had a fiance named 
George. Few years later, Carlo and Abbie get to know each other in a mountain hiking. They met very often although they didn't
want to. Abbie's heartbeat responds fast whenever he is with Carlo, maybe it's because of Hanna's heart. And soon they fell in 
love with each other despite the fact that Abbie has a fiancee. But later in the series, Hanna's heart started to reject the body of 
Abbie. And the new heart that was transplanted of her was of manmade. George lied to Carlo that she had died in the operation. 
So 3 years later in an unexpected scenery, they walked parallel both having their umbrellas. Although they're are many people in
that place, Abbie felt that her heart responds the same way as the years before when she is near to Carlo. They get to see each 
other again after 3 long years.</P>
