<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of Joni Ericson had really touched my life.. It all started when she was 15 years old, 
she is swimming then while she was swimmin', she bumped into the cement with her backbone broken. Then she was rushed to the hospital right away then the doctors suggested surgery.. she was given a tranquilizer and anesthesia to let her sleep.
so the operation gone to over 8 hours. 
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a day later, she awaken, she didnt know anything about what happened, then she looked down,
she saw she was in a wheel chair then she panicked.. Then her mother told her that it will be just for a month. so she believed her then the nurse 
came to let her eat food.. then she moved her face towards the plate, she cant move then she wondered what is happening. she knows her mother 
and father is lying to her. 
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cried, she said: "I think, I know what happened, Am i paralyzed?" Nobody answered then she freaked out..
so they told her that she is now quadriphlegiac.. she was stunned.. Then she became depressed and she is very angry at herself.. it took 3 years to let her accept it..
then after the recovery, she was sad so she thought then she should write a song, it became like a therapy for her.. so she wrote 200 of them.. 
then she applied for record companies. No one said yes to her because of her condition.</P>  
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was depressed she is not in control of her life now she is very dependent but she never let
her situation ruin her dreams.. Then someone shared the gospel to her, then she realized that no one can help her but god only, the mighty one, 
and He knows everything about her, so she prayed.. a lot. Then one day, a christian record company called and they said they had heard of her condition.
then she said ofcourse, then the rest was history.</P>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a truly wonderful woman because even if she's handicapped.. She strive harder..!
she is persistent in what she does and she helped lots of people including me.. So I thank her for that.</P>
