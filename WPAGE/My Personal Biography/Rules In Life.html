<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In life, we must set our own rule so that we'll not get lost
of my track towards success. If we have rules, then we have disciplines in ourselves. Here are my 8 rules in life:</P>
<OL Type="1">
<li><P>I will not commit myself in a relationship until I'd reached 25 years old.</P>
<li><P>I will study hard in order to help my parents in their daily lives.</P>
<li><P>I will strive hard so that I could get a better job someday.</P>
<li><P>I'll always managed my time effectively.</P>
<li><P>I must not get affected by what others say of me.</P>
<li><P>I must be objective not subjective.</P>
<li><P>I must live my life to the fullest.</P>
<li><P>I must not only focus myself on studies but also in other field of interest.</P>
</OL>
