<B><P align="left">I tried to climb the mountain today. As I inched my way<br>
up the path, I felt overwhelmed, so I had to turn back.</P>
<P align="left">I tried to climb the mountain today. On my journey, darkness<br>
started to fall, and I was full of fear, so I had to return to<br>
a safe place.</P>
<p align="left">I was ready to climb the mountain today. But it<br>
was so hot outside, I thought I better stay in my nice<br>
air-conditioned house and rest up for tomorrow's attempt</P>
<P align="left">I was about to climb the mountain today. But I had so many<br>
other things to do, so instead of climbing the mountain I<br>
took care of much more important tasks. I washed my car,<br>
mowed the grass and watched the big game. Today the mountain<br>
will just have to wait.</P>

<P align="left">I was going to climb the mountain today. But as I stared at<br>
the mountain in it's majestic beauty, I knew I stood no chance<br>
of making it to the top, so I figured why even bother trying.</P>
<P align="left">I have forgotten about climbing the mountain today; until a<br>
friend came by and asked me what I was up to lately. I told<br>
him I was thinking about climbing that mountain some day.<br>
I went on and on about how I was going to accomplish this<br>
task.</P>
<P align="left">Finally, he said, "I just got back from climbing the mountain.<br>
For the longest time I told myself I was trying to climb the<br>
mountain but never made any progress. I almost let the dream<br>
of making it to the top die. I came up with every excuse of<br>
why I could not make it up the mountain, but never once did<br>
I give myself a reason why I could. One day as I stared at<br>
the mountain and pondered, I realized that if I didn't make<br>
an attempt at this dream all my dreams will eventually die."</P>

<P align="left">"The next morning, I started my climb." He continued, "It was<br>
not easy, and at times I wanted to quit. But no matter what I<br>
faced, I placed one foot in front of the other, keeping a<br>
steady pace. When the wind tried to blow me over the edge,<br>
I kept walking. When the voices inside my head screamed<br>
"stop!" I focused on my goal never letting it out of sight,<br>
and I kept moving forward. At times, I was ready to quit, but<br>
I knew I had come too far. Time and time again, I reassured<br>
myself that I was going to finish this journey. I struggled<br>
to make it to the top, but I climbed the mountain!"</P>
<P align="left">"I have to be going," my friend said. "Tomorrow is a new day to<br>
accomplish more dreams. By the way, what are you going to do<br>
tomorrow?</P>
<P align="left">I looked at him, with intensity and confidence in my eyes, and<br>
said, "I have a mountain to climb."</P>
