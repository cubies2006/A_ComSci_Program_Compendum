<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some of my characteristics that I considered to be
positive of myself:</P>
<OL Type="1">
<li>PERSISTENT
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a type of person who wants things to get done within a given time frame. 
This is true when I'm dealing with projects. I always try my best to do it. For instance in Programming, our instructor always gave us Machine Problems in every term. It was
a fun thing to deal especially when you're really applying what you had learned from the lessons you had studied before.</P> 
<li>HARDWORKING
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very hardworking. Because I always had a habit of studying within and beyond the subject. Of course, only in my subjects
of interests like Math and Programming Subjects. I always try my best to get high grades in my academic subjects. It can only be achieved by
mastering all the lessons that I had studied and learned in the university.</P> 
<li>RELIABLE
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a person with a word of honour. I can be trusted to do what is expected or has been promised. When I borrow something from
a person. I always return it back to him or her on time. This can prove that I can be trustworthy.</P> 
<li>INTELLIGENT AND SMART
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people see me as smart and intelligent but I think I'm just fine and cool, my classmates, are impress at my grades... 
and I see it as a strength because intelligence can be brought wherever you go..AND LEARNING IS NEVER ENDING EVEN IF YOUR TOO OLD YOU COULD STILL STUDY</P>
