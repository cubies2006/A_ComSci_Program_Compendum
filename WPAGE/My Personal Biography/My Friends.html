<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends are the group of people who makes my day bright. Honestly, 
studying alone is fun, but when you have no one to talk with, it's pretty boring at all. Since no man is an island. Then
everyone needs to have a companion and to socialize. But I can say that not all friends are trustworthy, but there are 
few royal friends out there that will always be there for you in times of trouble and misery. Because when you have
a group peers, I believe that they're majority of them were not royal to you, so I don't dare to have a group of friends
but rather few friends only who are true and good.</P>
<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Here are the list of my friends from elementary to college in which their surnames 
are arranged in alphabetical order:</P>

<P align="justify">I had first known her when I was Grade 3. She is very nice, talkactive, and very caring. She indeed has a good heart. She is very
humble and generous. She sometimes helped me in my Art projects in our M. A. P. E. subject. She is one of my closest friends during my elementary years.
She didn't became classmates during the next 3 years in my elementary years. But our friendship continues in our high school years.</P>

<li><Font Size="4" color="DeepSkyBlue" face="Tahoma">Cruz, Alvin Roman</Font><IMG src="roman.jpg" height="40%" width="15%" align="left">
<P align="justify">He is one of my closest classmates when I was in Grade 6. He is really good in Mathematics. He joined many Math and Science contests.
He sometimes taught me Math and Science subjects. I really appreciate his generosity in imparting knowledge to me. He also told me about Playstation game
console, which is very popular during this time. He also knows how to play many sports like soccer, basketball, badminton, arnis, and many others. I'm
really happy to meet someone like him who is really helpful. I hope that he won't change and continue to impart knowledge to others.</P> 
<A NAME="#Link3">
<li><Font Size="4" color="Magenta" face="Tahoma">Pernia, Vanessa A.</Font><IMG src="vanessa.jpg" height="40%" width="15%" align="left">
<P align="justify">When I was Grade 5, it was the first time that I had known her. She's beautiful and very popular because she's a very dynamic kind of
person. She can't live with friends. And also she can act well maybe because she aspires to become an artist someday. But fortunately, I became one of her 
friends although we're not that close. She excels at Filipino very well. And she has honors during this time. But later on, she focuses more on friends than 
studies so when she'd reached High School she losts her honor.</P> 
<li><Font Size="4" color="DeepSkyBlue" face="Tahoma">Sy, Alvin Arthur</Font>
<P align="justify">He is one of the most honest classmates that i'd ever known in my elementary days. He is very diligent in studying all of his subjects.
He told me many animes and PC games that are popular during that time. He inspires me to join Math Club in our Extracurricular Activities. He got good 
grades over me. He gives me advices about studies and badminton. He encouraged me to join Badminton during the first 2 years of my high school years. 
We didn't get to communicate with each other since he doesn't have a Friendster account.</P>

<li><Font Size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Cainglet, Jacqueline Sue</Font><IMG src="cainglet.jpg" height="60%" width="20%" align="left">
<P align="justify">After 3 years since the elementary years, she became my classmate once again. But now, she's not only my closest friend, but also
my best friend too. During this years, she shows her ability in communication and writing. She joined our Scribe, the official article in our school
published every after a semester. She excels in English and Filipino, but poor in Math. As a friend, I do teach her and fortunately she passed. I
really do miss her till now, because we'd share many years together as friends. But because of college life, we had to part ways. We only get to meet
each other when there is a Reunion held in our school. I'm very grateful to have a friend like her who makes my day bright during my elementary and 
high school days despite busy schedule and loads of assignments to deal with.</P>
<A NAME="#Link4">
<li><Font Size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Chan, Jennifer</Font><IMG src="jennifer.jpg" height="60%" width="20%" align="left">
<P align="justify">She is one of my classmate who has many suitors. Maybe of her distinct charisma and appeal within her. 
She has a gift of dancing, communicating with others, being business-minded, and being a romance-book lover. She is one 
of my closest friend during my 3rd and 4th Year in H. S. We talked just about anything - music, movies, PS games, and many
others. She is one of my group members when we're making a thesis in English about "Music - It's History and It's 
Instrument". Unfortunately, I do not know of her whereabouts since we graduated.</P>

<A NAME="#Link5">
<li><Font Size="4" color="DeepSkyBlue" face="Comic Sans MS">Choi, Van Weily</Font>
<IMG src="van.jpg" height="45%" width="20%" align="left">
<P align="justify">He is a very good friend of mine. I remember the times when he was being paired by my classmates to 
Jacqueline as a perfect couple. I befriended him and Jacqueline which led to an issue. Most of my classmates say that
I'm the rival of him for the hand of Jacqueline. He is got to be one of the most brightest classmate of our time. He's 
very superb in his Chinese studies. He has a very wide knowledge in Chinese language and culture. He's very reliable 
when during my first 2 years, he helps me do my assignments in Math and Science. He's currently studying at DLSU Manila
taking up Chemical Engineering. I didn't get to see him for 2 years now since we'd graduated.</P>
<A NAME="#Link6">
<li><Font Size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Chua, Hong Hong</Font><IMG src="hong_hong.jpg" height="45%" width="20%" align="left">
<P align="justify">She is Joni Mae's bestfriend and one of Jacqueline's friend. So it is a must that she should be my
friend too. She's very sports-minded and business-minded at the same time. She's very much different to my other female 
classmates. Because she used to speak Chinese language than Filipino and English languages. She has difficulty in speaking 
Tagalog. In Chinese, she is one of the brightest students in their batch.</P>
<br>
<A NAME="#Link7">
<li><Font Size="4" color="DeepSkyBlue" face="Comic Sans MS">Chua, Michael Erick</Font><IMG src="Mech.jpg" height="60%" width="20%" align="left">
<P align="justify">He is one of my closest and funniest classmates that I had known in my high school life. He transferred
to our school during our 1st Year H. S. During the first year of being at school, he is very quiet. But a year later, he 
started to get talkactive and wacky. When we'd reached 3rd Year, he gets more talkactive and wackier than ever. By the way,
he's very athletic. He virtually knows almost all sports like basketball, volleyball, arnis, chess, swimming, tennis, 
badminton and others. He is also good in Mathematics and Computer subjects. Despite all of his achievements, he still gets
to be a very happy-go-lucky person and very funny. Currently, he's taking up Computer Engineering at DLSU Caloocan. We still
get to keep in touch through Friendster.</P>
<A NAME="#Link8">
<li><Font Size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Lazaro, Joni Mae</Font><IMG src="joni_mae.jpg" height="60%" width="20%" align="left">
<P align="justify">She is one of my bestfriends in the school. She is sweet, caring, sincere, nice, simple, and diligent.
She is very active in school because she is a member of the Student Council body. She loves to study Filipino and English
subjects especially the Panitikan or the Literature part. She usually comfort me when I'm feeling down and low. She gives 
me the inspiration to study hard during my 3rd and 4th Year respectively. She is the only classmate that I confidently 
entrust all my secrets and problems. She's currently studying at PNU which means that she'll be a teacher someday. 
Unfortunately, I can't get in touch with her because she is very busy in her studies. But I hope that someday, we can get
to meet other again and reminesce all the happy moments that we had during our high school days.</P>
<A NAME="#Link9">
<li><Font Size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Lim, Aileen</Font><IMG src="aileen.jpg" height="60%" width="20%" align="left">
<P align="justify">She is one of the most fascinating people that I had ever known in our school. She is as white as 
snow like snow white. She's so simple and very down to earth. She is a type of person who loves novels about romance, 
horror, and others. She told me before that she preferred to read books than to watch a motion picture. Because when 
you read, it can widen your world and your own imagination to think of. She is also intelligent. She is the 3rd Honor 
in our class. She's currently taking up Accountancy here in UE Manila.</P>

<A NAME="#Link10">
<li><Font Size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Lin, Yan Hong</Font><IMG src="yan_hong.jpg" height="40%" width="15%" align="left">
<P align="justify">He is the one classmate that I first perceived as very arrogant and all-knowing but I was wrong. He was nice,
not that arrogant, willing to learn from his studies, and one of the most popular classmates of our batch. He became my classmate
since I was in Grade 5. When I'd reached 4th Year, I used to become his "Instant Reviewer" in Social Studies quiz (World History).
I never thought that he was the only one who greet me when I'd graduated aside from Joni Mae and Jacqueline.</P>

<P align="justify">She is the most talkactive and very active in our batch. Because she's the so-called "ARTISTA" or I should
say "MISS POPULAR" in all levels from Elementary to High School. Although she is not that intelligent, but she has various of
talents like dancing, acting, and singing. We first became classmates when I was in Grade 5. And she's very annoying at that 
time. Because she feel that she is much better than other people because at least she has a brain during that time. But when 
High School days come, she became more attached to friends which led to her downfall. Since then, her attitude changes for the
good. And we became friends when we'd reached 3rd Year. And I instantly became her mentor in Chemistry and Physics and of Math.
I won't ever forget her role in our "Filipino Drama Play" during our 1st and 3rd Year, wherein she played as Donya Juana and Sisa respectively.
I heard that she has also many suitors, but she's not ready yet to get into a relationship. She's petite but terrible!!!</P>

<li><Font size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Policarpio, Raychelle</Font><IMG src="raychelle.jpg" height="35%" width="15%"

She also gives me the encouragement of studying hard and giving me good advices to stand and deal with my high school days. She is 
one of our CAT Officers. But I still consider her as an ordinary classmate full of joy and life. I last met her during her debut 
held last May of this year.</P>
<A NAME="#Link13">
<li><Font size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Tan, Rowena</Font><IMG src="rowena.jpg" height="40% width="15%" align="left">
<P align="justify">She is one of my closest friends in my Chinese class. We became classmates ever since Grade 3. Just like me, she retained for
a year. We are so closely attached because she loves to talk with other people. She sometimes gave me good advice when I have a problem that is 
a true friend. From Grade 3 to 4th Year of Chinese, we're classmates. But when 4th Year English comes, we both don't have Chinese classes anymore.
During Thursday and friday, we have P. E. and C. A. T. to attend respectively. So we and some of the retainers of English meet at the Library to
study and chat about anything. She is studying at Fatima taking up Nursing. I really do miss everything about her.</P>

<br>
<li><Font Size="4" color="DeepSkyBlue" face="Comic Sans MS">Amante, Mark Roger</Font>
<P align="justify">He is one of my best friends in my college life. We became classmates during my first study here in UE. At first, you'll 
thought that he's arrogant, but he's not. He's "VERY SUPERB" in Computer Programming, as in he is one heck of a "COMPUTER GENIUS". He is really 
good in Math subjects. Although, he is good in Math and Computer subjects, he is weak in subjects like English and Social Sciences. He also 
plays Basketball as a Anti-Stress therapy to him. He is very gifted. Believe it or not. He didn't jot down notes and he only listens.</P>
<li><Font Size="4" color="DeepSkyBlue" face="Comic Sans MS">Castillo, Argel Joseph</Font>
<P align="justify">He is one of the most mysterious classmates that I'd ever known. At first, you'll notice that he looks like Morgan in 
"Bananas In Pajamas", but later on you'll recognize that he's one of the finest in our class. He is very humble, talk less, and a good friend
of mine. He's a Logic addict. He got a very high grade on our Philosophy subject when we're on 1st Year. It's because he liked it very much. 
He also like Math and Computer subjects just as Mark Roger do. And also he's a best friend of Mark Roger. They're very close as if they're twins.</P> 
<li><Font Size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Cedro, Hanna May C.</Font>
<P align="justify">She is one of my dearest classmates this college. She is the only person that I entrusted to keep my secrets, although some
are revealed by her. She constantly relies on me at Math subjects because that subject is an "Instant Killer" to her. She aspires to become the
future Song Hye Kyo. She loves Harry Potter so much that she is desperately want to become a sorceress in the series to challenge Harry Potter 
himself. She also likes Endless Love 1 and 3 only. I can say that she's very talkactive, friendly, and reliable. Currently, she's not my classmate
so I'm hoping that we'll be classmates on the next semesters to come.</P>
<A NAME="#Link14">
<li><Font Size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Dumago, Shyrmay</Font><IMG src="Shyrmay.jpg" height="50%" width="20%" align="left">
<P align="justify">She is one of my closest friends in college. She became my classmate during the 2nd semester of last year. She 
has multitudes of friends. According to my classmates, she is really good in P. E., although she is petite. She mimics almost all of 
the most attractive commercial in our country today. For instance, she knows how to "beat" (the popular endorsement of Coke). She also 
excels in her studies. I think she likes to drink Milk so that she will grow taller. She is really great in programming Visual Basic, 
Pascal, and other Programming Languages. She is very friendly and reliable. She is one of my friends in Friendster.</P>
<li><Font Size="4" color="DeepSkyBlue" face="Comic Sans MS">Lappay, Louie</Font>
<P align="justify">He's one of the most friendly, reliable and responsible classmates that I'd ever known this college. He's usually funny but at times he's very
serious. He is a very happy-go-lucky person. He has many friends like Argel, Ivan, Vincent, and many others. He's also very diligent in doing Computer
Programs.</P>
<li><Font Size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Mangilit, Aimerica</Font>
<P align="justify">She is one of the most finest faces I'd seen in my college life. She's very nice, caring, and ok to be with. She's not that
talkactive, but I can say that she has many suitors. She occassionally consult me in Math subjects also like Hanna. Currently, she's not my
classmate because she's on CCC. I hope that we'll be classmates on the succeeding semesters.</P>
<A NAME="#Link15">
<li><Font Size="4" color="Magenta" face="Comic Sans MS">Tamondong, Ailene</Font><IMG src="ailene.jpg" height="40%" width="20%" align="left">
<P align="justify">She is my classmate when I first started studying at UE Manila. She is very quiet when no one is talking to her. But
when people talks to her, she is very talkactive. She is one of our finest classmates in terms of Programming, because she is very
literate in different Computer Languages. I think she is kind of secretive in terms of her personal life. She is also one of my friends 
in Friendster.</P>
